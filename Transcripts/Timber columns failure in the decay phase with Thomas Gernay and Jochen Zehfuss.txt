 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show, another episode related to timber. So I guess that's getting everyone excited. I usually see more interesting timbery episodes than any other type of topic in fire science. I really wonder why is that? I guess it's one of the most exciting things that happen around and one of the least well-understood problems in fire science for people outside of our core group of fire science engineers. And my today's guests have certainly steered the attention to the problem and the issues and some features of it for sure. With their posts on LinkedIn that went absolutely crazy. They've posted a video of a collapse of a column under load. The column was heated for a fairly short amount of time, like 15 minutes, and then left all alone, still under load. And after 90 or so minutes, it just cracked. And that was one of the shortest and easiest visual representations of what the threat looks like. The fact that fire has ended doesn't mean the structural performance is from now unhindered by the consequences of the fire. The fact that you have a completely different material that behaves completely different at certain temperatures, at certain points of heat transfer into the element. That's beautiful fire science, absolutely beautiful. So after I saw that poster, I had to invite them immediately to the podcast episode to discuss the decay phase collapse and all the stuff around that. It's still an early research. I think they've pinpointed something explicitly important for the fire science and the design of timber buildings. And it seems they're looking further into that. So more is expected to come. But I'm very happy we're able to share these riddles with you at this point. My today's guests are Professor Thomas Jernay from Johns Hopkins University. He was already in the podcast talking about structural fire engineering. So you're very welcome to check that episode as well. And the second guest is Professor Johan Zeffus from Technische Universität Braunschweig, who has carried the research that we are talking about in here. The collaboration was much larger and you'll learn about it from the episode, but these two guys I've invited to talk and to talk with it. So let's not prolong this anymore. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzynski and I will be your host. Hello everybody, welcome to the Firesize Show. Hello, everybody. Welcome to the Fire Science Show. I'm here today with two guests who did quite a mess on LinkedIn a few weeks ago by their post on failure of timber element. That is Professor Thomas Chernet. Hey, Thomas, great to have you back in the podcast. Hello, Wojcic. Thank you very much for having me. And a new guest, Professor Johan Zeffus. Hello, Professor Johan. Very nice to have you in the show. Hello, everybody. Fantastic. Thank you for taking my invite. You seem to be superstars now with your research. Actually, I'll describe if someone missed what happened. You have performed an interesting research into timber column failure during the cooling phase and posted a post on LinkedIn with a video of the failure. And for engineering standards, it went quite viral. And I found it super interesting because you've captured in a very visual way one of the things we really struggle to discuss. It's super difficult to explain to someone why decay phase would be important and you with the 10-second video have nailed it perfectly. But let's not have this episode about the video. Let's have it about the research that led there. So how about we discuss the decay phase overall? What is the decay phase, and why would we care about it at all? Indeed, it starts with looking into how real fire develop and grow and then decay and understanding what effects that can have on structural stability and on structures. And in the child fire community, there's been a shift to going to those performance-based fire design approach. So we want to really understand on the real fire how a structure is going to respond. And so in the community, we start to understand that when the gas temperature in a compartment starts to decrease, that's not the end for the structure, far from it, because for one, there is going to be a thermal lag. There is going to be this heat waves that continues penetrating deeper in the sections. And so you have the core of the section of your structural members, which temperatures continues increasing. As a result, their strength and mechanical properties continue decreasing and you can have delayed failure. This is simple physics. This stands true for all material. You always have this heat wave comes from the differential equations of heat conduction. So it's independent of whether a material is combustible, such as timber, or non-combustible, such as steel and concrete. And so many people in the community have been becoming more and more interested in understanding that, quantifying that threat of delayed collapse. We have also seen some real fire accidents that were delayed failure during cooling that can be particularly threatening to firefighters and first responders who might be inside buildings. So it's very important for us structural fire engineers to understand that. And from there, we started working with modeling. And then now we move to experiments, and eventually to these experiments on timber columns. But this delay phase, this late failure, or maybe even post-fire failure, within our paradigm of fire resistance and ISO curve and RAE classes, it's not there. I mean, the standard curve goes up all the way, it never goes down. So it's not a part of our paradigm today of testing structural members, right? Yes, that's right. The resistance class approach is, say, a very simple approach we use all over the world with the ISO 834 curve that is also a very simple model of the realistic fire. But as it is a very simple model, you can subject all elements for this ISO curve. And of course, we neglect the cooling phase. And as Thomas said, we have this delay problem. This is also a problem for concrete elements as well, not so much for steel elements, because they have a very high heat conductivity and they are not so massive in the cross-sections. But the difference for the timber, between timber and concrete, is then, of course, that timber is a burning material. Concrete is then, of course, that timber is a burning material. So that we have not only the delayed heating where the core is heated later or in the cooling phase as well, and we have also fire or a reducing cross-section caused by the burning. As we know, the burning happens till the fire is nearly extinguished. We have also burning in our cross-sections with temperatures beyond 300 degrees in the cooling phase. And then another point is, as mentioned also in the paper, the degradation of mechanical properties of timber, for example, which degrades until temperatures of 100 degrees and even lower, where we lost capacity or strength. I just wanted to point out that I actually had a podcast episode with Felix Fisna about the moisture transfer within timber elements and how the thermal wave propagates. He has tortured me with very scientific terms, but it was a popular episode for some reason. Maybe it's the magic of Felix, but indeed a lot happens within timber at quite low temperatures because let's face it, 100 degrees for a fire temperature, that's not a very high temperature. So you can probably expect this to be reached very deep into your element. So now let's talk about when have you realized that such a research is necessary and the differences may be so big that it really requires calls for additional investigation? really requires calls for additional investigation. So on my end, it has been quite a long process of wrapping my head around this issue of delayed failure. I can trace it back to 2010, 2011 when I was working on my PhD and I was developing a material model for concrete in fire. And I was focusing also on the cooling phase, trying to get those material properties and reversibility right and transient creeps and all of that. And so as part of this, I was doing some numerical modeling with columns, loaded columns. And when I was applying natural fires with the cooling phase, I could observe in some cases delayed failure. So that was 2010, 2011. I said, well, that's interesting. And as I mentioned, there had been a few accidents, such as the Gretzner bus parking in Switzerland, where there had been a failure in cooling. So I thought that's something to work further on. So a little bit later, I started trying to systematize this study. And I had a paper with Jean-Marc Franzen where we proposed a standard indicator to try to approach the problem of burnout resistance or resistance to full burnout in a systematic way with numerical modeling. And when we applied this approach to different types of structural members, we identified that it was possible to show that timber was possibly more at risk for the reasons mentioned by Jochen. And really, most of the reasons are the fact that you have this very low conductivity, so the heat transfer takes a long time, coupled with reduction of strength at low temperatures. So even if for five hours after the fire you get to 80 degrees C, 100 degrees C in the core, you lose a lot of strength. Just to put number, if you trust the Eurocode Annex B on advanced calculation methods, at 100 degrees C, the reduction factor for the strength is 25% for compression and 65% for tension. So you've lost actually most of your strength, right? And so from there, I did more numerical modeling, studying reinforced concrete columns, timber columns, and so on. And we could indeed show that the burnout resistance for timber was significantly lower than its fire resistance, meaning there was a risk of failure under relatively short fire. but there were still no experiments that had specifically been designed to to quantify this so testing members loaded under heating and cooling to to see the failure so finally there was this great consortium with lots of lots of institutions and colleagues who had all been working on this issue you know independently i was so oh we, we should do something together. So on this timber experiments, of course, Johan, who is here, who conducted the experiments, but in the consortium, there is also Cérib with Fabien Robert, Jean-Marc Francen at University of Liège, Robert McNamee at RISE, Patrick Barmonté in Milan, and I think I'm not forgetting anyone, but that's a great team. So we work together to devise and experiment to be able to study this and try to be as systematic as possible and show what the behavior would be. From my point of view, I think in the last 10 years, we made in our institute several projects on the fire behavior of timber structures. Most of them, of course, were protected, strips and boards, but then I think in most other European countries we have a trend to applying more timber buildings, or there's a trend to build more timber buildings due to, for example, sustainability or decarbonization reasons and so. And so building regulations are changing and they need research. And so we had in several projects the question, what will happen when we have timber elements which are not protected? Massive timber elements, for example, CLTs and so on. And how many percent is allowed of the enclosure to be unprotected? And then there was also the question, do we have a self-extinction of the timber elements when the so-called mobile fire load furnishings and thus is burned? But on the other hand, we have the timber which is also burning, which is called structural fire load. And we see in several projects, it's not so easy to predict self-extinction and depends, of course, on the geometry of the fire compartment, on the oxygen flow and some other parameters. And so self-extinction is, I would say, a very seldom case. In some circumstances, it could happen. And then, of course, there's the question, what will happen in the cooling phase when the cross-section is reducing, reducing, reducing? And then, of course, there could be a failure. And this is our motivation to go deeper in this subject. And then we find ourselves in this group, as you said, the European champions. I don't know if this is the right word. All-stars, European all-stars. But some of the leading researchers from the European countries think it's a good thing that we find together and do a systematical research, investigating also the approach of Thomas, that we write a method, which was originally used for concrete elements and to adopt that now for timber elements as well. Beautiful. So tell me more about the research. I already see there is so many. I'm noting the factors that you mentioned. There was different losses in compression, in tension. I guess the utilization factor of the element would play a big role. Johan mentioned technology. So I guess when we come like glued elements like CLT, it must be super interesting. So tell me, how did you approach this research to really like narrow it down to the most interesting and where did you find the most interesting thing to go for? The key idea is to be systematic and to find a way to, I would say, almost standardize the quantification of the behavioral structural elements under fires that include the decay phase. So the approach that we proposed consists in subjecting structural members to fire of varying duration of heating phase until identifying the shortest fire that leads to failure or the longest fire that could be survived indefinitely to burn out, if you want. So this threshold. In order to do that and to be systematic, what we propose is to use the heating according to ISO 834, since everybody's familiar with this heating, but then to stop at some point and to have a linear cooling phase that is in accordance with the Eurocode parametric fire model. So why a linear cooling phase that is in accordance with the Eurocode parametric fire model. So why a linear cooling phase? Because we could take any cooling phase, but the only natural fire that is in the Eurocode that is qualified is the parametric fire. So we may as well take that one and everybody can take that one. Sorry, Thomas. And it's important to note that is the cooling of the furnace itself. So it is the external boundary condition imposed on your element. And what happens in the element is the physics of the element. And that's what you're looking at, right? Exactly. So we are talking here about temperature in the furnace. But once the temperature starts decreasing in the furnace, of course, in parts of the elements, the interior temperature keeps on increasing. So this is the idea. Find the burnout resistance, the shortest fire that leads to failure. And then from there, we devised an experimental program, a test matrix, where we built identical specimens. So we had, for the timber, we had eight glulam columns, identical. We defined the load on these columns, assuming that they were in a typical building and doing the Eurocode design. So they had utilization factor in terms of loading that would be typical in the fire situation according to the codes. And the only thing that varied between the experiments on each of those eight columns was the fire, the definition of the, I would say, gas temperature time curve in the furnace, to be more specific. So we repeated all tests twice. We had tests to measure the standard fail resistance R. So for R, we obtained 55 and 58 minutes in the two tests. Then informed by the numerical modeling by finite element models conducted prior to the test, we had a test with a heating for 15 minutes, followed by the linear cooling phase. And we did it twice and the two columns failed during cooling, quite late in the cooling phase. So they failed after 98 minutes for one and 153 minutes for the other. So again, that's a column that's heated for 15 minutes. Then the furnace temperature is cooling and it fails after two and a half hours. What was the approximate temperature after 15? 600 something? Yeah, 700. That's not much for a fire that's heat flux of like 35 kilowatts per square meter. That's not huge in terms of exposure, to be honest. Right. And when it failed, so again, after two hours and a half, the temperature was in the furnace almost back to around 100 degrees C because it plateaus. It doesn't go exactly to 20, but it was cool. And then two colognes under 10 minutes heating, followed by linear cooling. And these two survived and we measured the residual strength. But so we reached our objective in this experimental campaign to test identical members, only vary the heating exposure, and have the three outcomes that you wanted to have. So measure the standard fire resistance, find a short fire, but that results in failure, and then find the slightly shorter fire that would survive. failure and then find the slightly shorter fire that would be survived. So we bounded this burnout resistance, this fire that's the threshold between failure in cooling and survivability to full burnout. Okay, I guess the most interesting thing is what's different in the 10 versus 15 minute fire. So how much did the temperature profiles inside vary and how big the difference was in what you've observed between these two tests? Yeah, it seems to be only five minutes difference in this DHP time, 10 or 15 minutes. But it means when you see on the ISA curve, the ISA curve is increasing very high in the first minutes. It's increasing very high in the first minutes, and there we have a difference about 100, 120 degrees between the 10th and 15th minutes. And that means that also in the cooling phase, because the cooling phase, the temperature time course in the cooling phase is parallel, starting from the 10th minute or from the 15th minute. And that means that we have even higher temperatures in the cross-section, which are approximately this 100 degrees and more. And then we have in the columns which survive the fire with a DHP of 10 minutes, we remain in the main parts of the cross-section under the 300 degrees. In the core, we had lower or very lower temperatures. But in the cases of the DHP of 15 minutes, we have higher temperatures in the core. So the cross-section, which remains under the 300 degrees, is very much lower. So to put it into perspective, the amount of heat that this column got from this additional five minutes of exposure, obviously now higher temperatures at the higher exposure, so the sum of heat just could penetrate so much deeper into the column that it pretty much damaged or weakened such a significantly larger part of the cross-section that under this load it was not enough anymore. That's a superb difference. But we're talking here about something that is heated from four sides. I hope you're comfortable with hypothesizing, but what if this was a slab? I mean, then we would be talking about one cell exposure. I would say that we can generalize that. Of course, not the numbers. The quantification depends. Members, the applied load, et cetera. And in a real building, all these will be slightly different. But it's important to understand that what we showed in those tests is not a fluke. It's not something particular that happened because of delamination or because of this specific column being heated on four sides. It's really a demonstration of the physics of the fact that heat transfer continues during the cooling phase and even thereafter. As a result, the interior parts of the sections get hotter than at the time of the peak gas temperature, and so they lose their strength. And if the loss of strength in the core is sufficiently severe, then it gets to failure. So this is true regardless of the thermal boundary condition in terms of the number of heated sides. It's true also regardless of the type of member. And again, it's true but to a different extent because material laws are different, but it's true also for concrete. And we had papers with numerical modeling that showed that for concrete. Also wanted to add that, so this phenomenon, we understand it, we can relate it to physics. And again, we were able to model it with finite element models, including before conducting the experiment. So it's not calibrating, you know, but a priori modeling. So we had the paper published before, and the agreement is actually quite close. Which, as a side note, is also interesting because finite element models of timber elements in cooling, at this time, they rely on properties, mechanical thermal properties, that are provided in the Eurocode, Eurocode 5 Part 1, 2 and XB, which have been derived based on ISO exposure for heating. So there was a little bit of an unknown whether predictions extrapolating to modeling the cooling would be appropriate. And through those experiments, we see that although prop properties can always be improved, overall, we can predict the behavior. So really, these models, finite element models, can be very useful in understanding and predicting whether there will be failure, including with our current knowledge of properties, which, again, I hope we improve. I hope we get that even more accurate, but it's already working quite well. Were there any other things observed during the test? Like maybe the failure mode have shocked you in a way? How did the failure mode actually look compared to the failure of the same element without any heating? Because I know you also crushed one of them, right? Yes, we also crushed one element without heating to be sure what load degree we assumed. As Thomas said, we defined the load degree in a way which was usual for, let's say, flat buildings following the codes. But in our tests, in our cold tests, we stated a very higher capacity as we assumed with the formulas of the code. So one reason might be that there is a very large spread due to the material timber, which you cannot compare with steel or with concrete. Yeah, the failure mode was for the fire exposed columns due to the reduced cross section, of course. And then let's say it was, I think, more or less the failure on the tension side where we had the mode in the tests we had for isofire and also for the tests in the cooling phase. So you mean the connections where the lamellas are glued together? Yes. So we have to go deeper in this tract, but these were the first insights we had. Interesting, interesting. And the timber was much stronger than your codes. I guess you've ordered the sample as a laboratory. They always send you the strongest samples they have, you know. Ruining science by sending the best. Maybe, maybe. Okay, okay. What stresses me about this experiment and the visuals, you know, when I do large T experiments with whole structures, you can usually see after the char turns white on the structures, and there is this char oxidation eating out your column, and you see these giant glulam columns slowly but very steadily disappear in front of your eyes. Especially, we had one test, there was a massive steel joint at the bottom, and you could literally see more and more of this steel joint coming out of the column. That was really stressful. But it was stressful looking at it without knowing your experiments. Now, knowing your experiments, it's exponentially more stressful because I do not see what's happening inside. And now, when we don't have combustion, but there is char oxidation, I guess this is also also exothermic process. So again, this one, it generates new heat. So the heat propagates again into the column element. And the other problem is what Carmen Gurska has shown in her PhD. It's hot. So the heat goes from hotter to colder. If the surface is hot, it's not going to go that way, right? Absolutely. So again, for all materials, even non-combustible, the heat travels from hot to cool. So it's going to keep on traveling toward the core. With timber, there is lots of additional complex physics going on. Because it's a combustible material you can have you know combustion can continue and here can is talked about self-extinction and how that's a challenge to to understand exactly and to know what's going to happen with respect to that you have smoldering and you have drying dehydration and so on pyrolysis right so again it's a combination of all of that timber is even more complex because it's combustible but even if we could control and make sure we have self-extinction we don't have smoldering there is a heat wave and a thermal lag and the thermal diffusivity is very low in con timber so it takes time and so if we are dealing with a building for which we want burnout resistance or for which we want firefighters, you know, to go inside to fight the building, we need to better understand and account for these delayed phenomena. We are not saying that it's needed necessarily for all types of buildings, that the fire resistance approach, you know, is not valid, should be thrown away. Absolutely not. It depends on the performance objective, so it depends what type of building we are dealing with. But you want to point that if firefighters are going to go inside, if a building is expected to, you know, they're not in a compartment and then stay stable, then you need engineers who take account and demonstrate that these effects are taken into account. How simple can it be? Like, do you need finite element modeling to solve that? Or maybe we can come up with some, I don't know, general rule or rule of thumb that could help you assess, okay, if your column was meter by meter and the fire has ended, you can expect this wave propagate for like three hours, which means it will reach the half of the column. I don't know, just spitting numbers from my head, but I think we need, especially on the subject of timber, where people get bored very quickly when you start going very technical because they want simple answers, you know, like isotherm for concrete. They want as simple as that. So can we make it as simple as that? Yeah, it is a very complex process. And so using finite element modeling, it's also more complex as for concrete elements, for example, whereas it's also complex for a usual design engineer, I would say, because we have all these phenomena, a smoldering, pyrolysis, and so on. But on the other hand, we need some simplified methods for design. But they are still not there, I would say, considering the cooling phase. There are some approaches also in the new generation of Eurocode 5. some approaches also in the new generation of Eurocode 5. But I think there is a lot of work to do, research work to do, because it depends on so much parameters when you look to the real fire. So this approach, the DHP approach, from my point of view, it's a very good approach to simplify the fire side. But to find the response of the element, it's not so easy. So I think there we need more work to find a simplified model which could be used for a daily design, for example. But do you think we can simplify it to just consider the thermal layer, or we need to model the structural response of the timber, the changes on the performance of timber as the temperature increases in various cross-sections, or maybe we can just simplify it to one isotherm and just be done with it. You mean like we have the approach now in Eurocode, which is only valid for heating phase, where we reduce the cross-section. A simple approximation of, okay, the heating stopped at this moment. How much further can the isotherm travel? So what I can say is that if we are interested in burnout resistance in cooling phase, we need to go past charring and charring rate. That's the first thing that is a big change in paradigm. So in the way we talk about it and represent it, because the resistance of the member is not going to depend only on the position of the 300 degree isotherm, if I want to simplify. So char used to be the whole thing we would care about. Now we consider this one of the array of things we need to consider. Correct. would care about, now we consider this one of the array of things we need to consider. Correct, because what's behind char is going to become very important and whether you have a heating that's, you know, more progressive but goes much deeper and you get 100, 100 degrees C in the whole core at some point during the cooling, then you have a behavior very different compared to if you have a massive section and the core remains cool, even if, I mean, the charring is equivalent. So that's the first thing. But then can we develop these simple design methods? We are not there yet, but we are working toward that. And I believe with some simplifications and so on, but it will be possible to have pragmatic approach. And our idea conceptually is that we would still have the fire resistance and we keep it, and it is useful, but you would add a second indicator, which is this DHP as required for duration of heating phase, to quantify ability to survive to burnout. And we would be able to play with the two indicators and hopefully to have simple methods for both. And then depending on the performance objectives, you would pick or require what is meaningful, what is necessary for both fire resistance and burnout resistance. And maybe for some buildings, there is no requirement at all for burnout resistance. Not that I vote for super simple methods or I want one. I'm quite happy with leaving engineering stuff into hands of competent engineers. It's just, you know, observing the history of fire science and understanding which ways have historically worked for a long time. Unfortunately, as someone said, we will never have enough competent fire engineers to solve all the fire problems of the world. So we need to put some tools into hands of people who may not be as experts. Conservative, simple rules usually work well within these hands. However, I already see an issue in here, given my experience in fire testing. Iso-Therm 100 degrees. If we care about 100 degrees, that's a tricky thing one, because you may have quite a large part of your cross-section at 100 degrees because of the heat of evaporation of water. So it's not like a narrow line that travels like the Charring 300. That's a very sharp interface. But 100 degrees, you can have quite a significant part of your cross-section at 100 degrees. Now I would also like to hypothesize a little bit. So you were talking about this duration of heating phase as your approach to test and you were focused on heating quickly and then having decay. How about heating slowly and for a long period of time? I mean, that's my immediate thought. It's a little reversed, but you would have safe phenomena. What would you say to that, Thomas? I'm glad you bring it up because now, as my opponent mentioned, that we are still working on that with the same consortium. We are very happy that we can continue this research. So we are now in a phase two where we are actually studying this behavior, but under natural fires. Now, really the approach was to be systematic. So we wanted to have a phase one where the experiments were as controlled, reproducible as possible. So it was done in furnaces with a controlled cooling phase. And everybody can see we did each experiment twice. The results aligned very well. Others can reproduce. But of course, it raises a lot of questions on the type of thermal exposure and how this behavior would be different if the thermal exposure, the fire is different, both in heating and in cooling. So we have been working on the phase two, and we already have some of these experiments. I cannot tell you more at this stage, but this is work in progress. So especially to your question with the slow heating, it's very interesting, right, because I presented this research at the Congress for Firefighters in France in May, and one of the firefighters asked me, what about if a colonist, maybe not even in the fire compartment, was very far from the fire, but it gets heated at 100, 150 degrees for very long, and it doesn't even char. But honestly, I mean, we've not really studied that yet, but it brings a lot of questions, because if you trust, again, those reductions of strength that you get in the Eurocode and that are from dehydration, drying, all those phenomena that other guests have explained very well on your podcast, Felix Wiesner, Danny Hopkins, and so on, you could have significant reduction of capacity from moderate heating. And if it's long, because it has to penetrate right in the section. We are not saying that a hot summer day is going to bring timber buildings down. But if it's from a fire that lasts hours and you have this thermal wave, something to investigate, yes. And in terms of localized fires and the damage to like ceilings, let's imagine we didn't have a fully flashed over fire. We just had, let's say, a vehicle burning or something burning in proximity of timber. Well, in that case, I guess we should consider the timber flammability. So the scenario may look not as pretty as I just described. Yeah, I would be less concerned about that in terms of the burnout resistance, basically, because what is critical in this concept of burnout resistance is the total amount of heat that penetrates the section, right? And it's the idea that even if it's over a relatively short time, or if it's a long time, but with no very high peak, if the total amount of heat is significant, you'll get, you'll heat also the core of the section. But if it's a localized fire, every case is different, of course, but you don't have that much heat that penetrates the section in the first place, I would assume. I have a question that may be stupid, excuse me, if it is. What if firefighters, let's imagine it is a real structure, what if firefighters apply the water on it and quickly cool the external surface of the wall. I mean, the heat is still inside, I guess, this time it travels both ways, but you'd probably still see the propagation inside and the damage would not be stopped by just sprinkling water on this external surface, right? It's an excellent question actually, because that's something we are studying. Yes, no, that's something we have identified as possibly an important parameter and we are studying and we want to quantify to what extent it helps. But if you can reduce the heat that is transferred still in the cooling phase as well. Yeah, we did some experiments on massive timber elements, CLT elements, where the ceiling and some parts of the walls were unprotected. And then we had one test where firefighters fighted the fire, extinguished the fire, and they used not so much water. It was about 3,000 liters. So it was only one experiment, and it was in a compartment of about 40 square meters. But they were surprised not to need so much water. When they cooled down, the surface, the propagation, or the penetration into the element stops very early. So I think that's not so a big problem. Of course, it's a bigger problem when you have a timber framework element, where you have a hidden fire or something like that. And the final one also to you, Johan. If you have a timber structure protected by, let's say, a layer of gypsum plasterboard, just to extend the fire resistance class of it, you would expect that at some point the heat goes through the board and can penetrate the column, and it would not cause an immediate structural failure of the arc criterion within the fire test, if you omitted the decay phase. In such scenarios, you would also be worried about the heat transfer. Is it the same scenario for you, or how do you view that? Of course, due to the drop-sum elements, you have a delay in the heating and then a delay in the ignition. And the velocity of the pyrolysis of the charring process is different, is lower, as we know, due to the lack of oxygen. But then after a while, the protection material on the boards will fail, and then you have nearly the same situation as you have for an unprotected element. We shouldn't consider this as a complete solution. It's just a delay to the processes. It may be a solution for the structure you are considering. It may solve the problem for the one, but you need to understand and measure that. Fantastic. Okay, thank you very much. This was very insightful. I need to get one more thing out of you. A thing that we can clearly share with our colleagues, architects, structural engineers who are not very keen in fire. So let's try and nail the one most important thing that you've learned here that differentiates why this would be different from, let's say, steel structure or a concrete structure. Thomas, you want to start? So timber burns, that's something obvious we know. And because of that, a lot of the focus on ensuring fire safety of timber tends to be on understanding the charring speed and how long it takes for this combustion to proceed and so on. And what we showed with those experiments is that, of course, all these combustibility issues, self-extinction, etc., are important, but they are not the whole story if you are interested in stability to full burnout. Because timber also is affected by heat at temperatures lower than pyrolysis or combustion temperature. There is a lot going on, dehydration, drying, lots of processes. So everybody needs to remember that even at relatively low temperatures, timber is affected. And because of that, a timber structural member continues to see its strength, its capacity decrease for hours after a fire, during and after a fire. So we should take that into account if we expect firefighters to go inside buildings or if we expect buildings to remain stable, remain standing under a fire. Johan, you want to add something to that? Maybe how to use it? Yeah, I could emphasize. I think one very important issue is for the firefighting strategy. When they go into a timber building where we have a fully developed fire, they have to be more careful even after hours. Because we have a higher risk for failure in the cooling phase, as I think we can say this, as when we have a concrete structure. But on the other hand, as we said, we are not against timber, not at all. Timber can have a very high fire rating. It's a question of design. It's a question of dimension. it's a question of design, it's a question of dimension but especially in the firefighters when they come late when they are in a very early stage of the fire starting with the firefighting process, the problem is minor I would think, but when we have a very long time starting the extinction, the risk is higher that we have a failure in the cooling phase than when we use other materials. Thank you. Thank you very much. A very much appreciated message to this part of my audience. And for structural engineers who would like to approach this process, recognizing the issue is enough and they will know what to do? So in this research, as always, we want to first observe, understand the behavior, and then provide the tools to have solutions. Jochen has said it's very important, so it's certainly not being against one type of solution or another. There are solutions to build fire-safe, with every type of structural systems materials. So we are working on the solutions that structural engineers today can use finite element modeling. Our research suggests even with the effective properties from Eurocode 5, you get really good agreement with those experiments. And we are working on providing the simple design methods for DHP. Fantastic. And when you do that, make sure to come to the podcast. My pleasure. You're already invited. Guys, once again, congratulations on your research. I think what we've talked today may not be that easy from understanding it perspective, but it really is very visual when you see the failure of your element and you immediately realize what happens there. I think you've shown a very important distinction. Why there is such a movement in the fire community on researching timber. I mean, you've really captured one of these differences that really is there and may have a critical impact. And as Johan said, especially impact on the firefighters in the phase that they would usually consider safe based on their experience so thank you very much for that and I'm very looking forward to the secret project you've teased us without using the word traveling at all actually thanks thank you guys thank you thank you very much and that's it super nice people doing super nice research European all-star team researching timber for you I really love how we start getting all the puzzles together to be able to clearly say what makes timber and fire different than other materials in fire it seems that we're on a great route to to finally identify all the issues hopefully all or at least most of the issues and be able to actually communicate them and be able to work around them and you know by understanding that that's the first step to finding solutions if we don't understand what's happening if we don't understand what's happening, if we don't understand what's different, we are unable to act. And if we do understand what's different, we can work around that. That's beautiful. The research was carried on single type of an element, single size of an element. So definitely we need more. We need to understand better what's happening at the columns that are larger cross sections happening at columns that are larger cross-sections, at columns that are heated at different rates of heat exposure. But that's all to come. What we have now is the first indication that the numerical models were showing something that really happens in reality. They've demonstrated the physics that this collapse can take place. And yeah, we know more today. We know more today and we can already act on this knowledge. So thank you, Thomas. Thank you, Johan, for coming. Thank you for leading this beautiful research. And I must say, I'm really, really looking forward for more coming from this collaboration on the collapse in the decay phase. It's really exciting research to look at. Listeners, thank you very much for staying here with me, and hopefully see you here next week. Cheers. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
