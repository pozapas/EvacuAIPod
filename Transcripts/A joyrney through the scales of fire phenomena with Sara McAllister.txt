 Have you ever wondered how diverse the world of fire really is? I mean, in the end, it's all just non-promixed combustion in turbulent blooms, where entrained air is mixed with some gaseous fuel and release energy within a chemical reaction. But yet, if you look at the matchstick of candle flame, a wood crib, a building or a forest, it seems that these phenomena are completely different. And I often wondered what makes them differ so much from each other. What is the physical background of these fires? And what really makes each of them unique at their scale? And this is the topic of today's episode. And I have a fantastic guest to talk this over with. She's a distinguished young scientist, recipient of the Early Career Award from International Association for Wildland Fire. She's burned thousands of woodscrips in her career and participated in some research that has been praised as a paradigm shift in understanding wildland fires. And obviously, we're going to discuss both of these topics today. She's also very involved in growing the community through large outdoor fires and built environment workshops and working group of IFSS. And we're cordially inviting you to join that. So, yeah, let's welcome Dr. Sarah McAllister. Let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzyński and I'm here with Dr. Sala McAllister from US Forest Service. Hello, Sarah. Great to have you. Thanks for inviting me. My number one requested guest finally here. I'm really hyped about that. So Sarah is famous for her science related to combustion and combustion fundamentals and applying this research on fundamentals into practical world of fire engineering, especially wildfire engineering. Can I say that? Wildfire engineering? Probably not. I think it's a thing. Let's call it a thing. It's a thing now. It's a thing now. It's been coined here. So a good place to start is a quote from Hottel, from a paper from Guillermo Reyn, who are praising your research. And the quote was, a case has been made for fire being next to the life processes, the most complex phenomena to understand. And I absolutely agree, trying to learn fire and flame. And I guess, what are your thoughts about this? Is fire easy for you? Well, of course not. I mean, it is just even fire alone. I mean, it's heat transfer, it's combustion, it's fluid dynamics. It's a lot of really difficult engineering topics all rolled into one. And then to make it even worse, there's wildland fire, which combines forest ecology and, you know, the way that plants live and grow and photosynthesize to really get into, like, the nitty-gritty of how a wildland fire works. So, yeah, it adds even more layers of complexity on top of it. So, yeah, no, definitely not easy. I call it job security, though. Yeah, even without topography and wind, probably, it's already crazy. And once you add these little complexities into the equation, it turns a little bit more complex. So I had this idea for this interview. Like, I have top combustion scientist in front of me. So let's talk about how combustion affects fire and fire engineering. And I would love to walk with you through the scales of fires because as someone who has done experiments on my tabletop, experiments in my lab and burnt buildings. I mean, it's all shiny and produces the smoke, but behaves in a quite different manner. And I assume within outdoor fires, it's the same. Let's start with the smallest scales. Let's think about a match fire or a candle flame. let's think about a match fire or a candle flame, you know? What would you say are the phenomena, the simplest phenomena that would drive these fires? Well, I think that also depends on which way you're holding the match, right? Okay, yes. Holding the match where, you know, it's burning from the top down, you're going to get a very different process than if you're holding the match upside down and trying to not burn your fingertips, or even holding it sideways so that the flame propagates kind of horizontally across it, right? And so, much like a candle, there's a lot of processes going on, right? You need to transfer heat to unburned fuel to pyrolyze the fuel. That fuel then has to mix with air and ignite, you know, the typical process. But, you know, how that heat is transferred really depends on the direction that that flame is propagating, right? So if it's downward, you can't, the unburned fuel can't necessarily, air quotes on, see the flame, right? Radiation isn't going to be very important for downward spread. You were talking much more about conducting some of that heat through the solid. You're also doing some gas phase conduction or convection. You're kind of probably splitting hairs at that point, right? Because the velocity isn't zero, but it's pretty minimal. So is it conduction or is it convection in the gas phase? But, you know, if you hold that match upside down and that flame is propagating upwards, you have a lot more opportunity for radiant heat from that flame to heat up the unburned fuel to spread that fire. But you still have, you know, conduction through the solid phase and you still have some convective heating. So as that matchstick gets bigger and bigger or as those flames get bigger and bigger, the balance between what is driven by convection versus radiation is going to change, right? And that's that complex problem of scaling. When I was preparing for the interview, I was trying to think out a fire problem in which convection would play the dominant role. And I actually couldn't figure one where it could be like the dominant for the flame spread in a small scale, let's say. But I figured out that once you introduce heat sinks to the equation, conduction can become the driving force. So suddenly you have all three ways of heat transfer, how you produce it, how it goes away, playing a significant role, even at the small scale, right? Yeah, and certainly the thickness of the fuel can change all three of those balance, right? Because if you've got a thermally thick fuel versus a thermally thin fuel, that role of convection or conduction, pardon me, is going to be a little bit different. But, you know, what's really interesting about wildland fire is the importance of convection, right? Because as you mentioned, the heat sinks, very thin, fine fuels like a pine needle, if you're trying to talk about spread from one pine needle to the next, you really need to consider convection heat transfer, both in terms of heating and cooling, right? If you were to put a clump of pine needles in front of just a pure radiant heat exposure, say, you know, you have a radiant heater that's 40 kilowatts per meter squared of radiant heat flux, and you put a clump of pine needles in front of it, nothing's going to happen because of convective heat transfer. Like away from like. Because of away, right? It'll cool. Even just by natural convection, there's enough airflow for those fine little fuels to cool off against something, even like a 40 kilowatt per meter squared heat flux. And conversely, those pine needles heat up very quickly to convective heat transfer if you've got some kind of flame contact, right? So the context of the fuel really matters too in terms of if you're talking about big surfaces that are going to be much more receptive to radiant heat transfer and not so sensitive to any kind of convective cooling versus very small fuels like pine needles, especially when they're dangling in air in a tree canopy. They're going to be very sensitive to convective cooling, and any little breeze or even just natural convection can cool them down from a pretty significant radiant heat flux. Okay, so here your airstream, because your object is so small like a match or a needle, it just either is there and goes around it or doesn't, it does not exist. Let's go a bigger scale. Let's go item scale, single burning item, a wood creep, an armchair. And here, there are different ways the air can go, not only above and below your item. And this was also a significant part of your research, right? Yeah. So, I mean, if you're talking about a big impenetrable surface like a sofa or something, right, I mean, you're not going to get really much in the way of airflow through it, right? Very different from, say, like a wood crib where you have a porous fuel bed and you can get a lot more opportunity for airflow through it, which makes the fuel bed kind of burn much more uniformly, right? You can get in-depth burning in something like a crib, but, you know, a couch is kind of going to likely burn from the outside in, right? Just because there's not enough air in them, in it. So, you know, when you're able to burn something like a porous fuel bed, you're going to get a lot of, you know of radiant heat transfer within the fuel bed that's going to help drive it, certainly convective heat transfer from the burning elements hitting other burning elements. So that makes that kind of process much more complicated and also a lot more interesting. We will come back to the wood cribs. I have like 72 questions about wood cribs here because I'm passionate about burning wood cribs and I want to do the best cribs. I have like 72 questions about wood cribs here because I'm passionate about burning wood cribs and I want to do the best. Yes, who doesn't like wood crib, right? But here, okay, so far we are at the item scale and here's still just the fire. Let's put the item in the compartment and suddenly the physics changes. The fact that it is in a compartment and means it's constrained by the walls, by the openings. Suddenly it's not just a buoyant plume and flame. Suddenly it's a smoke layer that has some temperature radiates heat downwards. So your heat fluxes are not just the ones that are within the source itself. But suddenly the fuel, the ones that's burning, the one that is not burning, is like completely surrounded by, if you will, by the radiation and heat being transferred around. And suddenly the behavior of your woodcrip, of your sofa placed within the compartment, will be completely different than one outdoors or in your wind tunnel, right? Certainly, yeah. And, you know, the other thing is, you know, as everything gets scaled up and bigger and bigger, you're dealing with a lot more turbulence, which is making your flames thicker, which is making them sootier, which is making radiation be much more dominant of a heat transfer mechanism as well. So, I mean, all that's at play here as well, too. Yeah. When you think about the classical theories for compartment fires and you go into work of Thomas and then Haramathy and now what José T Torero is doing, there was this way to separate this into two regimes, one where it's like ventilation driven. So you have this amount of air that can penetrate your compartment and that pretty much dictates the amount of heat being produced in the fire. And in this, let's say we have this more or less salt, maybe not completely, but we feel pretty comfortable for the last 30 years with this type of fires. And then there's the other regime in which you have more than a sufficient amount of the air and the processes inside are in a way chaotic, like they depend on where the air is, where it can flow, where it burns. It's very complex. The temperatures are lower. And this is very, very complex, very difficult to describe with simple empirical model. Such model does not exist. And if I remember correctly, Howard Emmons said it's going to happen around 2050. And then Jose said he's not so optimistic about it. So if these two guys I'm not sure if we can solve it that's a powerful problem but I was wondering like in this case the interior of the compartment is very like similar to the interior of your wood crib because it's always also how deep can the air go into it right yes yeah so as you were talking I was you know like oh yeah this is so it's like so cool that there is such a that the analogy is very similar to wood deep can the air go into it, right? Yes. Yeah. So as you were talking, I was, you know, like, oh yeah, this is like so cool that there is such a, that the analogy is very similar to wood cribs, right? Because there's the same two regimes of wood cribs, right? So if they're very dense, the airflow just can't penetrate them very effectively. And so they're ventilation limited as well. So as you, if you were to, you know, widen the spacing in the cribs and make them more and more open and loosely packed, then you get this transition to a different behavior. And so there's two different relationships to predict behavior for a wood crib just based on those relationships as well. What's interesting is that the open fuel bed configuration in a wood crib is actually a lot more predictable than in a compartment fire. Okay. Yeah, because at that point, they basically just assume that the elements of the crib are burning at the individual rate given a particular external heat flux. So it becomes only proportional to the diameter of the fuel particle. But when it's confined, then there's a lot more variables about how the airflow can get in through there. And that's actually the challenging regime. Woodgrip is trying to figure out what happens when the airflow is restricted, how much air gets through, and how that changes the burning behavior. Okay, let's go bigger. Let's exit the compartment. Let's take a giant Christmas tree and place it outside because for some reason, fire engineers are very passionate about burning not only wood cribs, but also Christmas trees. Have you burned a Christmas tree? I have not yet. No, I have not burned a Christmas tree. Oh my God, we're in a club. I know, but it's like I work for the Forest Service, I've studied wildfire, and it's not burned a Christmas tree. It's almost a sin. We're both earning our living burning up things, and we have not burned a Christmas tree. I hope to graduate to a Christmas tree, though, very soon. Okay, I'm going to burn one in my in my lab this year probably need to eat for statistical reasons and fun yeah but yeah but let's imagine a giant object such as a tree and in the green room before we we've entered and you told me that trees uh the christmas tree don't look like that in the forest and there there is something to that. How would a single item like this, what would drive the fire of like a single giant tree? Well, so that's a good question, right? Because I, as I was talking about, you know, like a single pine needle versus a clump of pine needles is going to be, you know, a very different context. Because now you have arrays of fine fuels. And so certainly when you're talking about, you know, a fire that's transitioning from a surface fire, so just burning onto the ground into a crown fire, you are igniting it from the bottom up. So you do have your candlestick analogy where, you know, things are going to be bathed in flame as it goes up. And so because of the context of the needles, you're going to get a lot of that convective heat transfer from flame contact as that tree kind of, they call it torching, right? You torch a tree from the bottom up. But when you have, you know, a big spreading crown fire, you know, you have much more of a horizontal propagation, right? So that's kind of a little bit different context. And often there is a ton of radiation. Right. So that's kind of a little bit different context. And often there is a ton of radiation. And for the longest time, we've always just assumed that it was radiation that was driving these fires. Because, you know, it's it's certainly igniting some of the downed logs that are down on the ground because they're bigger. And it's just a huge number. And it's just a huge number. And, you know, especially as people like that's what we feel when we stand next to a fire is the heat flux. Right. So we just sort of like naturally apply that to a pine needle. But, you know, we're still looking at that same process of, you know, those dangling pine needles in the air are going to be very sensitive to any kind of cooling from convective heat transfer. So you still need that flame contact. But it happens in a very interesting way because of the way that the flames have to come. Essentially, they have to come down and forward into the fuel bed, which doesn't make any sense when you've got big, buoyant plumes on Earth with gravity that want to go up, right? So that's always been kind of the crux of trying to figure out how convection can be important in wildland fire is how can it go forward and down to keep igniting the fuels. And it turns out that there's some really cool fluid dynamic instabilities in flames that create turbulent structures that actually do force the flames down and forward in the fuel bed. It's, I wish I could, like, draw pictures. I know this makes the podcasting hard. You have to describe it with words. Yes, I know. So what was really interesting is one of the things that our group had kind of really, I hate to say the word discovered, because it's something that is so totally obvious now that we've pointed it out. because it's something that is so totally obvious now that we've pointed it out. You know, if you hand a kindergartner a crayon and you ask them to draw a fire, they're going to draw these peaks and troughs, right? It's going to be a jaggedy-edged thing, right? But those jaggedy-edged flames are actually very important to the way that the heat is transferred because the stuff that goes on in the troughs of those jagged peak flames is actually where all the action is happening, and you can actually get that convective heat transfer that goes down and forward into the fuel bed. So, yeah, so it's a really complex problem you're talking about. So if you, like, put a row of fire science show logos next to each other, you will obtain this pattern of picking flames and holes between them. Yes. And this is what you observe. But please don't worry about observing things that are obvious. I had this time at the conference where I've told people that after 100 years of observing, the fire scientists realized that when we blow air on fires in tunnels, they grow. And that was our discovery, and people had a good laugh from that. But it really is like that. We just start considering the effects of longitudinal ventilation on tunnel fires and making them bigger, not just the ability to remove smoke from a tunnel. So looking at things that are in front of your eyes and actually understanding it in a completely different way than everyone before you understood, that's the eureka moment. And I wish every listener in the audience of Fire Science Show to have this eureka moment in their life because it's like, audience of fire science show to have this eureka moment in their life because it's it's it's like it's distinct clicks in your brain and nothing is the same anymore again like i mean you've always seen this phenomenon and you have never considered it being a mechanism that may be the driving force of these fires and now uh by looking at the video it's like, oh, it's obvious. Well, I think it became obvious only because we did a whole bunch of experiments where we got rid of every other variable ever, right? I mean, because most people, when you see these things, they're out in the field or you're doing wind tunnel tests where you've got like pine needles spread across the table. But you always kind of blow them off because you're like, well know, pie needles spread across the table. But, you know, you always kind of blow them off because you're like, well, there's clumps of fuel. So what we're seeing must be a result of there being clumpiness in the fuel, no matter how, you know, smooth we try to make it, there's always clumps. So we always saw them, but, you know, it wasn't really recognized that it was a fluid dynamics thing and not just because the fuels were clumpy or something, you know? Okay, we'll go deep into it. First, actually, you know what? In your PNAS, in the paper, first authored by Mark Finney, and congratulations to him for first authoring this magnificent paper, and you're one of the authors. In this paper, at the site of the PNAS, there's a bunch of videos from your experiments and they're excellent to watch. So I'm what I'm going to do is I'm going to link in the show notes, link to the paper and link to the videos. And I think the paper is in open access. But if you cannot access it, I will help you steal that. So come to me. I'll help you get it. And for those who don't want to go that far and click the link of a video, the mechanism we're talking about is that the fire in a forest, because we now enter the forest, is not a wall of fire like you would see in Lord of the Rings movie. However, the physics made it move like that as well probably in the movies. But it's not just a continuous wall of fire with the same height. It's like you will have a part of it that's very like high flame and then you will have part where the fire is almost non-existent. It's like down bottom and they change because as the fire moves, one grows bigger, the other grows slower. And by this movement, they force this, let's say, push of air that pushes the flame against the surface in front of it, like if the fire was breathing, breathing flame in a way. And this mechanism, despite the fact that the fire must and the hot air must move upwards because of the buoyancy, is the mechanism that actually forces this hot air, this flame to go like slightly to the front, half meter to the front. How much did you observe it move by one proof? Well, so that's actually research we're still doing. Okay, that's exciting. How far forward those flame excursions go and what temperature they're at so that we can kind of help put some sideboards on how that convection heating is happening. But it's the mechanism that, as you mentioned, radiation may not be the main. Well, radiation is certainly helpful because you're preheating your fuel. So it's very, very ready to be ignited, right? And as soon as you remove this cooling effect of the cold air surrounding the needle or the fuel in general and replace it with hot flame and products of combustion, then suddenly the magic happens and your needle ignites. And on the scale of the forest, this is what moves it forward. And now, okay, you've set your forest on fire. That's not very nice, but let's go with it. Hey, it could be a good thing. It could be a good thing. That's true. That's true. So that's another, this is probably another soapbox topic. Well, you told me we're not allowed to talk about fire management. But this is ecology. This is fire ecology. A lot of the forest, particularly in the western part of the U.S., evolved with fire, right? So they need fire to thrive and exist. It's a natural, natural process. It's a natural process that it evolved with. So, you know, fire isn't necessarily a bad thing in our forests. It just needs to be the right kind of fire at the right time. Yeah, I think this subject is something I have never considered it like this until I've met people like you, like Professor Rain, like Professor Stoof. Once I've realized what they really say, it's really like clicked again, this moment. It's obvious. It's in front of your eyes. If we allow the ecosystem to follow its natural, let's say, circle of life, we're not going to have this once-in-a-thousand-year fires every month, right? Okay. we're not going to have this once in a thousand year fires every month, right? Okay, so let's go back to the forest that's just been ignited because now the fire is quite big. And what's fascinating for me in, let's say, wildfires is that the terrain and the wind will play such a tremendous role in where the fire will go. So if you have the exact same forest, exact same source of ignition on, let's say, top of a hill, bottom of the hill, this will be two completely different fires. If you have it in California where you have the wind, the Santa Ana wind from the hills to the ocean, and if you will have it on the other side of the same mountains, it's going to be a completely different fire, right? Yeah. So what's driving the fire then? Because it starts to seem it's being the external conditions that start to take the driver's seat. Right. So it's very interesting because this is one of the, they call it the fire behavior triangle, right? So this is something that is so fundamental to wildland fire, you know, that it's the fuels, weather, and topography that drive wildland fire. That's the other fire triangle, right? You know, so we all know that a fire will spread faster uphill or it will spread faster in a canyon. We know it spreads faster when the wind blows. But, you know, the funny thing is we still haven't been able to exactly explain why, because we've argued about those mechanisms of heat transfer for so long. For so long, yeah. So, you know, I mean, there's some of the more obvious explanations of, you know, when the wind blows, the flame tilts over, so you're preheating your fuels faster, right? So whether or not that's because of radiation or convection has been, you know, argued about still. So same thing with the uphill, right, is if a fire spreads faster uphill, the flames kind of start tilting over because of the, you know, the relationship, the angle with gravity, right? And then at some point, if your slope is steep enough, it will actually attach. And this is something that I think was studied in depth after, say, like the King's Cross fire. Okay, yes, you're right. It's a similar process of where you get this, like, all of a sudden the flame just sucks down to the surface, and then you can get, like, crazy fast fires. And again, you know, the argument of whether or not the crazy fast fire spread is because of radiation or convection, still ongoing and still debated. You know, a lot of it has to do with that context, like I said, of the size of the fuel, whether or not you're talking pine needles that are in the air or you're talking about, you know, wooden steps or something, right? It's very different. In terms of inclination, I'm actually going to link a PhD thesis of Professor Mike Gullner because I found it's really good. And the fact he did his PhD on matchsticks adds additional beauty to that and props to Mike and what about the wind? Because the wind is a phenomenon, it's a natural phenomenon when I talk with fellow fire engineers and they usually tend to replace wind with some just flat velocity inlet of a certain velocity i always tell them this is as if we just replaced uh the whole complexity of a fire with a single temperature value which actually we do but both of these concepts are are equally horrible and wind is wind is a phenomenon. And what's fascinating about wind is that the wind at the surface is the outcome of the interplay at the upper levels of the atmosphere. So it does not necessarily be stable. It rarely is stable. So it changes the directions. I know the real difficulty in modeling the wildfires, the wildland fires. If you had the constant wind and the same slope, you would probably figure out an average velocity. Actually, that's probably what the Rothermel's model would give you, more or less. And you're game. You solved the problem. But your topography is rarely like just uphill and your wind is never a constant value that would be unified in space. So I think this is something that brings you additional challenge to what you're trying to model. I mean, do you also research that or maybe take it into account when researching the fundamental scales of the combustion? Well, so there are certainly some that have been working on, you know, what that wind profile looks like, right? Because as you say, it's not steady and it's also dependent on the vegetation on the ground, right? Because you ultimately care about the wind that's hitting the flames, right? So you're talking about the wind very, very close to the surface of the ground, right? So that same wind in a field of grass is going to be different than that wind when it hits, say, a tree canopy. And so how that wind profile changes when it hits those obstacles and how it decreases or accelerates if it goes back into the open is certainly a huge challenge in trying to figure out how to do modeling a fire spread. You know, there's, you want to talk about scale issues too, is when fires get big enough, they can actually make their own wind. That's a whole nother like can of worms to have to deal with, right? So that's a whole other can of worms to have to deal with, right? And that can totally have very different feedbacks on how that fire burns when it starts making its own weather. That's what I wanted to touch on as the final act in the journey through scales, because we're entering the megafires when the wind is a product, what's happening in the upper layers of the atmosphere but at some point the fire can enter the upper layers of atmosphere with the with the bouillon plume and when it does it starts to be quite let's say unfunny i mean it's a it's absolutely like if you're a fire scientist and you read about the physics of mega fires it is fascinating like it it's's absolutely fascinating. But at the same time, these are the moments where people actually die. These are the most horrible fires. We had one of such fires in Poland in 1992. It was in a forest called Kuźnia Raciborska. It was a fire created by a train. A train was stopping and it was producing a lot of metal sparks flying into a forest. And it ignited quite a significant part of a forest at the middle of a very dry season. And then, you know, a lot of firefighters went inside to fight the fire. And then, unfortunately, all the elements clicked for a megafire because you need to have a certain stability of the atmosphere to allow this fire to affect the upper layers of the atmosphere. They had the weather, like almost no movement is actually the best weather for such a thing to happen because no movement can be replaced by the movement by the fire. replaced by the movement by the fire. And I have colleagues who have attended this fire, and they told me it was like a firestorm, like truly the air started burning, the fire was everywhere, and you had literally seconds to hide because you know it was coming. And in the pictures, you can see a lot of trees being broken. And fires do not bring trees. It's wind that does break trees. And the wind was created by the fire. So in a way, the fire has created, let's say, a local hurricane-like effect in this region. And unfortunately, two of the firefighters have lost their lives in this fire. And these events happen, yeah, these types of fires happen over the world, especially lately, where we allow this accumulation of the fuel in forests. And if all the elements click, you get this very, very nasty, nasty physics. And you know what I've learned about this the most, there's a scientific report by Pitts from NIST, who's touching the post-war fire research, like nuclear wars, and how can a nuclear warhead create a fire to destroy a city. Don't need a nuclear fire to do it. We unfortunately figured it out in World War II. But also, well, it was not a war fire, but it was post-earthquake fire, if I'm not wrong, in Japan. The Great Kanto Fire. There was also a huge fire well that destroyed a whole prefecture. So what's happening there? So eventually, it's the fire driving itself. So it's no longer external things. It's the fire itself itself. So it's no longer external things. It's the fire itself, right? Right. So, you know, one of the things, you see, we've learned a lot from, like you mentioned, that research into how to totally level cities, unfortunately. But, you know, the same kind of thing happens in wildland fires. As you mentioned, as fuels accumulate, you get a lot of stuff that burns for a very long time. Our normal concept of wildland fire being just a line fire that moves through and propagates, ignites fuels, they burn quickly because they're fine fuels, then they go out. So that kind of a concept of how we normally idealize a wildland fire falls apart. And so if you get fuels that burn for a very long time, you start getting bigger and bigger areas that are generating heat and burning time, you start getting bigger and bigger areas that are generating heat and burning simultaneously, much like what was happening, but we unfortunately figured out how to do in Dresden. So you're able to get a long duration burning, which allows for this sort of spin up of this atmospheric thing to happen, right? So you get a really wide area, you get a really wide plume of smoke above it. And so wide plumes, I mean, you inevitably need to entrain some fresh air as a plume rises, right? Exactly. So the plume removes the air, turns it into smoke, let's say, and removes it from the place. So something must come into its place. Right. And if you removed one million cubic meters of air, you need one million cubic meters of fresh air from somewhere, and it's just going to suck it from the surroundings, right? And as the flume is wider and wider, it's actually less and less effective in training the air up in the atmosphere. So it has to come in from down on the ground, as you mentioned. So it's pulling all of that air that's going to replacement air to replace the stuff that would normally kind of try to get, you know, entrained in the plume. All is coming in on the ground now. And that's that fire-induced wind that, you know, can turn it into a total firestorm. And, you know, sometimes like in Dresden and in that great earthquake fire in Japan. The Kanto fire, yeah. The Kanto fire, yeah. If you get any kind of flow blockage so that that entrained air starts coming in at an angle, you start rotating the whole bloody thing. Okay. And that's when you can get that whole real true firestorm where you get that rotation in there that makes it even worse. I'm not sure if you know that research. I don't think it's widely known, but there was an experiment on this in the 80s in France where they have used 1,000 megawatt fire source as the source in their experiment. They were burning like this, let's say, house-sized heptane burners uh over an area of one square kilometer to see if they can create an artificial will like you just explained well i think luckily for them they did not create the whole world but they have observed the beginning of this spinning motion of the mass of the air surrounding. It was like 1,000 megawatts. When I started calculating how much I would have to spend on diesel to create a 1,000 megawatt fire, I was like, okay, we're not repeating that. Environmental people would not be happy about this scale of an experiment. But, yeah, I'm going to link it to the show notes. I think it's in open access, and that's probably the biggest fire experiment anyone has ever conducted. Around that same area, the U.S. was experimenting a lot with it, too. So they called it Project Flambeau. And they were also trying to figure out this whole megafire thing. I can't remember the numbers. We'll have to go back and look it up. But, yeah, they were piling huge areas of, like, juniper bushes over a huge area in the middle of nowhere and trying to get that same thing. The guy, Countryman and Project Flambeau, I think a lot of that stuff is declassified. I'm going to find it and I'm going to link it in the show notes if I can. And for some odd reason, I want the French to lose. And we don't know what was researched in Soviet Russia that much. Maybe they were burning something even bigger. So from a matchstick where you determine the flame regime by turning it up or down through a compartment where the feedback from your obstacles is deciding into a fire where the hot puffing motion will be determining up to a mega fire where the fire is determining itself and you've suddenly lost control it's uh and it's still uh essentially the same thing you know it's a turbulence transfer of air into a fuel mixture and just burning a super tiny interface between them that creates all this noise. It's kind of fascinating. Ultimately, the combustion still happens on millimeter scales, but now I'm talking about kilometers, you know. Okay, so let's go back to something more pragmatic, because I really enjoyed your research on wood crips. And it's not only that I love burning wood crips like every fire engineer does, and wood crips are an essential tool for our engineering. You were obviously researching that to understand the roles of fuel geometries in the fires better. But for me, it's a very practical paper on how to design wood scripts better. And I actually can see now how important the design of the source is actually because the effects you've described in your paper were quite profound. Maybe you can bring us a little closer to what you've done and what you've found because I found it fascinating and I wanted to hear it from you. Okay, so this started eight, nine years ago. We were, you know, sitting around the lab kind of puzzling, okay, well, how can we describe how a particular fuel bed in a wildland fire burns, right, whether or not we're talking about tree canopies or the pine needles on the ground, and basically decided that, like, you know, we can't study the real fuel because it's too complicated, right? There's just so much variability that we can't see the forest through the trees. How to do that, right? Like, we can't figure out the processes because we just, there's so much, you know, variability from one tree to the next, right? So we need... You need a more reputable tree, so you've jumped it down into a crib. We've jumped it down to a crib. And, you know we were like well hey look there's all this literature in the fire protection engineering using wood cribs right because you know they're used so often as ignition sources you know and there's this these great papers back from the 60s that kind of came up with this beautiful theory with the two different regimes and was predicting it but then you started digging into the the papers and you know they're and why you're predicting it. But then you start digging into the papers, and, you know, the cribs that they used were very sort of they were all cubic. They all looked like perfect little cubes, right? So they all had a perfect ratio of lengths of ten times their thickness and with the same amount of layers, so they came out perfect cubes. And so obviously the first question is, well, what happens when it's not a cube? Do these relationships still hold? So that was where we started was just playing around with what we thought was going to be a simple project of, oh, let's just throw some different things at it and see what happens. Right. And so we started building cribs of a wide different geometries. Right. And so we started building cribs of wide different geometries, right? So things that were short and fat and tall and skinny, looks like chimneys, just to see if those typical relationships held, right? And discovered along the way that sometimes is the answer. So it turns out when the fuels get thin relative to their length, so basically if you've got thin fuels in a wide kind of area, the typical relationships in the literature don't hold real well. Okay. But there is, so I mean, these are the ones by gross, by block, you know, kind of the fundamental ones that everybody kind of, if I had to stat, the fundamental ones that everybody kind of relies on. And they work great as long as you kind of stay towards the cubic side of cribs. So if you start building your cribs out of, say, like one millimeter diameter sticks, it gets a little messy, right? Especially if you're making them 10 centimeters long or even longer, right? So it turns out that there is a little known correlation by Thomas that actually works really well for all of them. But it doesn't clearly delineate those cool two regimes of, you know, densely packed fuel beds versus loosely packed fuel beds. So it's a little more uncomfortable to use because you can't, you know, calculate a crib porosity and say it's going to burn like this. Okay. But it works well. But along the way, we also noticed that the burning behavior is very sensitive to how far off the ground it is. Right. So there had been only a little bit of work in Bloch's PhD thesis that looked at the distance between the crib and the ground and how that affects things. Turns out it's a lot bigger difference, particularly for those fuel beds that are, you know, say, short and squat or made of thinner fuel elements. So that was a whole other line of work that we did where we were looking at the effect of the distance of, you know, of work that we did where we were looking at the effect of the distance of, you know, the height off the ground of the fuel bed and found that you do have to lift it up quite a bit higher than we thought in order for that to not be a variable, to not restrict the airflow through the fuel bed. Because it turns out that the airflow coming from underneath is a huge driving factor in how a crib burns. So from there, I mean, we have tried to answer all sorts of questions like what happens if you have like a wind or a forced ventilation. We've looked at moisture content. We've even tried to answer some of those questions about those, you know, those huge mega fires, right, and the restriction of the plume entrainment above it, how that influences, how that has a feedback into the burning underneath. So, yeah, I've in some ways sadly spent like eight or nine years burning cribs with probably thousands of cribs at this point, which is why I say I hope to graduate to trees. probably thousands of cribs at this point, which is why I say I hope to graduate to trees. But as I said, I learned a lot about how the flow through the fuel bed affects how it burns and how important particularly the flow from underneath can be. So that's really important information for trying to predict, say, crown fire behavior and how a crown fire will burn versus a surface fire will burn, where you don't have airflow that can come underneath. What I found fascinating about this work was that you found that when the fuel was thinner, actually more wind there was, it decreased flame spread, and with thicker fuel it increased. So it's like I would expect it always increases the spread velocity. That was a really, some really interesting and somewhat frustrating paper and experiment, set of experiments, right? Because we wanted to know the effect of wind and how wind would, you know, change things, right? Because it makes sense that particularly if you've got a densely packed field that's ventilation limited, it should make sense that if you can get more air into it, it'll burn better because there's a better mixture. You propagate the flame in sight, right, in a way. And so, I mean, the obvious first choice would be to put them in one of our wind tunnels and burn them, right? But it turns out that some of the results were kind of dependent on the actual experiment setup and the way that the wind would either go through it or around it, depending on the density of the fuel bed. So we weren't, in effect, able to control the amount of flow through the fuel bed because we had this external effect of it being a crib in a wind tunnel and the flow goes where it goes. You know, that was kind of the key finding there is that when the fuels were thin, it created enough flow resistance so that the wind went around the fuel bed instead of through it. And so that's, you know, kind of the explanation of, you know, why we saw kind of that unexpected result. But this is fascinating because you found that the role of the aerodynamics of your fuel source, and I don't mean the internal aerodynamics, but just, let's say, the bluff body aerodynamics, is key to the way how generally air can be transported inside the fuel where it can be burned. And you will see the same phenomenon in wildfire because because it's also here where you have very flat and, let's say, aerodynamically uniform source. But regardless, the aerodynamics will determine how deep it goes. But outside of the forests, in your paper, you've mentioned the tunnels, forests. In your paper, you've mentioned the tunnels that you've observed similar effects in like experiments done by tunnel fire scientists. And when I think about it, it's also like, wow, it truly was like in a way like that. And it's very frustrating to knowing what you've found to look at these experiments, because here you've exposed a source of uncertainty that can change, let's say, one or two significant digits in the experiment. Like you can turn a 20 megawatt fire into a 100 megawatt fire if you do the aerodynamics well. And it is not necessarily even the factor of the wind velocity in your tunnel. of the wind velocity in your tunnel. It can be just this actually alignment of the way how air can go around the object and not. Yeah. Similarly, how far up off the ground you prop it up. If you allow the air to come in from underneath, you're going to have a different burning behavior than if you block it off. Oh, you must be really good at setting up barbecues. This kind of knowledge is like priceless at the grill party. But it's also frustrating because then it's like, you know, we have all of these standardized tests that rely on, you know, crips as, you know, your heat input to the whole compartment or, you know, whether or not you're testing the flammability of decks or something. But, you know, we have to be very careful that how to build the crib as is intended and burn it as an intended, because if you miss something critical, like, oh, you know, putting it straight on the deck or lifting up off the deck, you can get different answers. And then your heat input is not the same as you would expect. When reading this paper, I was thinking about where in fire engineering we could actually use this, like crib research. And one thing that came to my mind was informal settlements, because these densely packed arrays of small buildings are similar to your densely or loosely packed wood cribs, because these buildings are fairly easy to ignite. They produce large amounts of heat very quickly. There probably is, again, this similar to crown fire, this buoyant push, convective push of heat to the next building. And I was wondering if this, what you observed, that the wood crips would actually translate to the larger scale. Well, and, you know, that's an interesting application that I hadn't thought of, right? Because I live in wildland fire land, so I was only thinking about applying it to wildland fires. But, you know, I mean, that's the real hope is that what we learn about, you know, the processes can be applicable at, you know, different scales, right? And understanding how the ventilation plays a role, how that has a feedback with the way it burns. And that is a very interesting application that I think that might be a worthy research project right there to see. Yeah. And it's definitely super useful to anyone who's building a wood crib. Yeah, because you need to justify that in the paper somehow, right? Well, I'm still burning wood cribs. Oh, right. Oh, yeah. Don't get me started on justifying things in the papers. Actually, in your paper, I found this excellent quote, and I'm going to read it out. And it was for your experimental discussion. And I absolutely love it. And all the postdocs and students listening to this podcast, take something to write and write it down. Though no particular experiment design scheme was followed, the fuel bed parameters were varied in an exploratory manner, probing for unexpected or nonlinear behaviors. This is good. I like breaking things. I want to break it. It's the most scientific way for writing. We guessed the sizes because we wanted to see the most varied set that we could. That's actually priceless. That's my take from the prep to this podcast. Okay, last thing. I wanted to talk with you, and it's also connected to all the things that we've discussed. You're very involved in the IFSS and namely in the group called Large Outdoor Fires and Built Environment. I see this initiative as very valuable to the world of fire science, see this initiative as very valuable to the world of fire science. And I would like you to introduce it to everyone listening to the podcast. Maybe someone would like to contribute or participate in it because I think it's worth it. Yeah, I completely agree. So the history of this went back to the IFSS symposium in Lund. We were invited. So Stan Manzello and Sayaka Suzuki and I are the co-leaders of this working group. And Sam was invited to lead a workshop prior to the symposium on the large outdoor fire topic because it's become, obviously, it's becoming a more and more pressing issue, right? It's affecting people worldwide. And so we had this great workshop with a lot of interest from people, and then IFSS invited us to make it into this permanent working group. And so the idea is that we can bring the entire fire protection engineering community together to kind of work on problems of large outdoor fires. And when we say large outdoor fires, we're talking about wildland fires, we're talking about wildland urban interface fires, urban fires, and informal settlement fires. Because the reality is at this point, any single fire can be all four of those, right? It can start in the wildland, spread to a community, whether that is a traditional built community or an informal settlement. And then those structures can then ignite other structures and become an urban fire. Yeah, and it includes, like, management of communities and also the management of emergency procedures, right? Right. Firefighters. So, I mean, obviously we're tasked with this huge group or huge topic, right? I mean, that's large outdoor fires in a built environment. So we kind of had to identify, you know, sort of some priority topics. And so we've broken the working group into three subgroups. So we have one on ignition-resistant communities that's looking at some of the thought and the standards and the exposures that a structure will experience. They're also looking at mitigation strategies for preventing that. also looking at mitigation strategies for preventing that. And that, you know, can range from, you know, ways of building and constructing informal settlement fires, but it can also include doing things like fuel treatments out on the wildland fire, right? This is where my passion comes in is, you know, you can harden your structure all you want, but if you've got a super intense crown fire coming at it, it's going to be much more difficult to harden that structure than if the fire was a much more tame, you know, surface fire, right? So if you can reduce the exposure, then you can, you know, have a much higher survivability chance. So that's one of our subgroups. Another subgroup is the emergency management and evacuation subgroup. So that's looking at, you know, how do we evacuate people? How do we manage the warnings and getting people out and, you know, looking at case studies of where we've been successful, where we haven't, and some of the lessons that have been learned. This will be a podcast episode. I'm sure this is such an interesting topic, how to actually manage community-wise. So you remove people in the perfect time and you convince them they need to leave, even though the fire is not at their footsteps. Because when it is, it's too late. It's difficult. Yes, I mean, this is a matter of warning people ahead of time. It's also looking at strategies for the routes to take. Often there's more than one way of getting out, which is the most effective. How do you do phase evacuations or do you put a blanket call of everybody out? There's a lot of lessons learned, too, that we're doing case studies for all sorts of fires. But, you know, what we've learned from evacuating before hurricanes and stuff like that is, you know, a source of information. And there's a lot of great people that are doing a lot of work on this. So I look forward to an episode on that. Yeah, I have a guest in mind. I'll make it happen. Awesome. And so the third subgroup that we have is the large outdoor firefighting. So this subgroup is looking at sort of kind of doing a survey, some of the tactics that are used worldwide and other things and some of the impacts of those tactics, right? So sometimes there's ecological impacts of, say, spraying everything with fire retardant, and there's health impacts of the way we fight fires. But there's also, you know, one of the things that they're working on right now is a survey of UAVs, unmanned aerial vehicles, and how they're being used in firefighting at all, you know, scales of the fire. So, you know, looking at some of those tactics and seeing if there's any kind of way to sort of um help kind of unify the way things are done and and uh the future looks bright in this field with the forecasting and i had seen huang in in my podcast who was talking about the use of ai and it also seems it could be promising for for for this and uh yeah i definitely see these efforts of of the group as very needed because the the subject we're tackling is bigger than any of us like it's bigger than your your agency is bigger than my institute it's not something that a single person can solve like like hotline said it's next to life processes the most complex to be understood. And I think through collaborations like that, through workshops like held on IFSS, it has certainly moved us a little bit closer into solving the issue and at least gave us the tools. I am very lucky to be in both the IFSS research subcommittee and the workshop committee for the next ifss so i'm i'm your supporter and i would love a lfbe to be a part of of this uh of this process because it's i think it's essential and uh the way how it's held like really getting people together to think about the subject, separate into like subtasks, but in, let's say, a democratical way, not prestige seeking way, not, you know, not necessarily competing about who will be the first to figure out how a retardant affects the environment, but working in a way together on pieces of the puzzle to figure out the whole image in the end, that is a fantastic way to collaborate. And I think this needs to be emphasized because we absolutely need more of that in fire science at every part of the fire science. Yeah, the more the merrier. So it is free and easy to join. If you go to the IFSS website, we do have a website there with joining instructions. It's a simple little Google form. You just add it to the mailing list, and then you'll hear about all of the work that we're doing. We also have our little monthly seminar series, so you can hear about that. Fantastic. Yeah. I'll share the resources in the show notes because it's definitely worth to follow and see for yourself and maybe you can contribute in a way. So, Sarah, thank you very much for coming here. It was a huge pleasure to talk with you about burning things for a living. It has certainly been a lot of fun and I hope the audience enjoyed that as well. Maybe we have armed someone to be a better incinerator. Or not. Well, yeah, thanks again for inviting me. I also really had a good time. It's always fun to talk about burning things, like you said. Definitely, definitely. We're going to do it again when you solve the mystery of the length of the buoyant push on the wildfires. Then save some time for part two. Thank you very much. Yeah, thank you. Cheers. Wow, what a journey that was. The world of fire is really diverse and fascinating. For me personally, there are some practical takeaways from this talk. First, I really have to watch out when I'm building my woodcrops and check these porosities and ratios of the scales of the wood creep because yeah it's a factor in the design and maybe it should be accounted for when we do compartment fire experiments with wood creeps as our fuel that's definitely something to look more into and consider in the future experiments. And also, as Sarah mentioned, it's quite important when you have standardized test methods that work with woodcrips, that you have to make sure the woodcrip is built to the same specification every time you build it. Because some changes in the structure of the woodcrip that will change how the air can enter and move through the woodcrip, penetrate it, will change the fire behavior of it and move through the wood crypt, penetrate it, will change the fire behavior of it and essentially change the fire. So that definitely is something to be considered when performing fire tests with wood crypts. And from the other things that were discussed, I think the one that fascinated me the most was the convective cooling of pine needles, me the most was the convective cooling of pine needles where this convective push of flame was necessary to create the conditions for the ignition of this porous fuel and this is like truly unique because i'm so used to define critical heat fluxes at which things ignite or even temperatures at which an item will ignite in my simulations that I wouldn't think it can work like that. But even at a very high radiant heat flux, you still may need this physical contact or this hot air surrounding the item to ignite it, especially when we're talking about such a small item. So that was something definitely new to me and definitely very interesting. So I hope you like this twist in the podcast to move into wildfires a bit because it's a pretty important subject. And even if you're not researching or working with wildfires, probably just as I am in my family, you're probably the family fire person, as I am in my family. You're probably the family fire person, and you probably ask a lot of these questions about the ongoing events in the world, the huge fires in the Mediterranean, in the USA, on Siberia. And to know a little bit better, you'll be able to give better, more scientifically accurate answers and just spread these good practices of wildfire management and dealing with fires because it seems we have to learn how to live with fires from now on. So thank you a lot for listening and yeah, see you soon.
