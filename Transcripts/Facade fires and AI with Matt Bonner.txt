 In the pursuit to change the building industry into something more environmentally friendly and trying to make our buildings green, and I don't mean the color, make them more net efficient, make them consume carbon, not release that while being built. that while being built. With all these efforts, I think we sometimes lose the sight on the fire safety of them. And some technologies introduced to improve the efficiency or other parameters of our buildings, maybe unintentionally change the fire properties of our buildings, leading to some really dangerous designs that end up with bad fires. And yeah, I think you can see that the most in the facade fire region, where it's obvious that we've seen more facade fires in the first pages of the newsletters in the last decade and through the whole length of time that I remember. It's obvious that there are more facade fires and they are bigger than ever. And they're growing to be a concern. And that's the topic of today's episode. We've talked to Matthew Bonner from Imperial College London. Today's episode, we've talked to Matthew Bonner from Imperial College London. Matt has spent a significant amount of time researching for SAT fires and trying to learn from what we have at the moment. And that was the results of experiments, tests done at different commercial labs using AI and some clever processing to filter out new knowledge from already existing data. And all of that allowed us to identify where the issues may be with the facade systems. And by knowing where the issues are, we can start working on solutions. And that's what we're going to talk today, touching subjects such as fire testing, using data to understand problems. There will be a lot of talking about complexity of facade fires, and a little bit of AI in there. So the research of Matthew is definitely exciting and interesting, and I hope you will really enjoy the chat I had with him about that. And yeah, without further ado, let's spin the intro and get into the interview. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzyński and I will be your host. Hello everyone. I'm here today with Dr. Matt Ponner from the Imperial College London. Hello everyone. Hey Matt, thanks for taking the invite. So my friend Matt is an expert on facade fires. Matt, can you tell me how it all started? Yeah, sure. Thank you for introducing me. Thanks for inviting me on the show. Very excited to be in the top first three people. That's great. Yeah, so actually it's quite interesting. So my background, I did my undergraduate and my master's degree, or my integrated master's degree at UCL in theoretical physics. My research projects, my master's research project was on like high, high energy laser physics. And yeah, when I applied for PhDs, I was kind of just I just realized I liked research. But I found that the theoretical physics was too theoretical. It's like, why am I even doing this? What's the point? And so I was looking for PhDs that had some sort of application to society, and Guillermo had advertised this project as like facade fires in AI. And I was like, ooh, artificial intelligence. I've done some of that. That sounded cool. And like facade fires, I don't know what, you know, I've learned nothing about fire and physics. I want to learn more about fire. So I applied. It turns out the reason I think they don't teach you fire and physics is because it's way too complicated. You know, it's not the realm of physicists. It's an applied problem. So I just sort of started. and and then that after eight months grenfell happened and suddenly what started off as a project that was kind of a minor thing that no one was really paying attention to everyone was suddenly asking me a lot of questions yeah it's kind of shameful it sometimes takes a huge tragedy like grenfell to bring attention to important subjects in our field and you mentioned that you jumped into the fire from physics and i know a lot of people actually did the jump and they've all ended up as great fire scientists so i think you're in a quite a good company yeah well i actually got very excited i know dougal dries there obviously you start off guillermo just hands you the introduction to fire dynamics book i'm like oh he came from physics and then also he has a paper on like the application of um dynamical systems theory to doing flashover and that was what my master's project had been using and i was like oh this is really related but then i realized like actually there's it turns out it's not just dynamical systems theory. It's also really complex fire dynamics, which took me a lot longer to pick up, I think. Oh, yeah. And what you've picked up, the facade systems in fire, I don't think these are simple systems either. So you actually had a paper about this, your first paper. And I'll drop the links to the papers in the show notes for everyone who wants to read up a bit in that paper you've uh pretty well nailed the complexity of the facade systems and uh and the multi-parametric issues around that maybe you can tell the listeners a bit about that yeah um that was actually really interesting. Starting on that paper was basically because when I started my thesis, like I said, I didn't know anything about fire, didn't know anything about facades. And trying to learn about it was really, really challenging because there wasn't really a guide out there that said this is what facades and fire are. this is what facades and fire are so i was the phd was funded uh in part by arap um who had the foresight to be seeing this as kind of an issue so a lot of people were interested in it in the fire team but they all had their language about facades that they were sort of talking about they had some ideas they also had a facade engineering team which had their own labels and ideas and different people in the teams had different cutoffs of like oh this is a rain screen this is a curtain wall system this is a um you know all these different types of facade systems and then in the literature there were other ones and i was like how do you and it turns out like they're actually way more complex putting them into categories doesn't work super well um so i just i was just trying my best to like add some sort of categories and basically use what little literature had been done in the past to see how you could put it together into some sort of coherent narrative um which is writing that literature review was as much for me to try and clarify my all these disparate things that were coming at me to clarify into a story that was as much for me to try and clarify all these disparate things that were coming at me to clarify into a story. That was as much of the purpose of it as much as helping other people in the same situation. And you're definitely not alone in being confused by jargon. And I was as well, especially in Fasaz when the solutions that you meet at your home are regional based on your local climate. So these things may be completely different when you go to Middle East, UK, Poland, or any other part of the world. I was also wondering, because UK has a history of energy efficiency, introducing energy certifications. And I think that this aspect of fighting for the energy efficiency of the building envelope was a significant driver towards the development of the new types of facades. So I was wondering how this aspect did affect your research. Yeah. Well, I'm certainly, I'm not like an expert on the history of energy usage or in buildings or anything like that. But definitely the big theme of like when doing this facades research of like why a lot of the components have changed and why there's a lot more plastics being used. used a big part of that is energy efficiency um because they want the facades to be more um thermally efficient so that you don't need to use as much energy heating the building and also similarly when we talk about cavities and stuff and self-ventilating facades that's a big part of zero zero energy buildings and zero carbon buildings and all this um and they're really cool technology but the problem is it's new and it's using and people just uh try and focus on that problem and be like ah we can add this component this will solve it this will solve it a lot of those new components are plastic because plastics are great it's basically a magical material but it also means if you're not thinking about the fire properties at the same time, you can get into a situation where your facade is suddenly much more flammable than you intended it to be when you were putting it together. Oh, yeah. And the market is expanding and there are new solutions pushed all the time. When you start considering the flammability of these things or the fire properties in general, it becomes very awkward. And this complexity, I mean, it seems very challenging to find what is the best solution to the whole equation of the efficiency. I mean, to what extent you can worsen the fire properties so you can justify the increase in the, let's say say net emission cut or energy efficiency of the building because the bottom line is if the building burns down and the facade burns down i mean it was not that sustainable in the end right for sure yeah and you're asking about like how can you find that point yeah that is that is the big question. And one thing that I throughout my PhD, my postdoc, like coming into this field, the complexity of the problem is mind boggling. Sometimes I talk to people who are like, oh, you know, we pretty much sold flame spread on the vertical surface or something. Now we're just worried about this and i'm like have we that's complex enough like fire is a phenomena is one of these you know complex phenomena where the small scales affect the large scales and the large scales affect the small scales in fact just fluids have that property before you even add all the thermofluids and pyrolysis and a bit of turbulence in the middle yeah and then when people say like oh you need to be holistic and think about evacuation or this stuff, you're just adding more and more layers of complexity that all feed back to each other. And, you know, complexity science as a field is very new. People trying to get their heads around emergent behavior, complex systems, all this. We haven't really done that as a society yet and i think like fire fire is still really um sort of struggling in that regard because it's a very new field itself it's working with fluid you know all these sort of old calculus equations which i think are you know really really useful and really powerful but it's not the only tool in the toolbox of complexity science i don't know a lot of the other tools, but one of the tools I was sort of looking at is trying to utilize more sort of big data analysis. You know, that's something which people have been using to try and tackle a lot of the complexity of economics and medicine or this sort of thing of like okay we can't tell exactly what's going on or like we know what's happening at the small scale but we don't necessarily know how that extrapolates to larger scales and all this sort of thing but we do have lots and lots of examples and maybe we can like fit a model to that of course that has its own challenges as my as I found out during my PhD, but that was where I was starting at. I was like, oh, okay, that's one way that people use in these other fields to tackle complexity. Maybe we can do the same in FHIR. I always found that idea astounding. You definitely changed my mind about using this powerful data that might lie somewhere in a fire testing lab to actually try to seek some new relations, seek new knowledge. So in our research, we focus to utilize this data from fire testing. data from fire testing. And while doing that, I've met some comments that the data from fire testing does not have the sufficient fidelity for doing that or that data will be inevitably biased towards some solutions, namely the solutions that pass the test because, in a way, the test drives the outcomes. So what was your take on that? Yeah, I mean, that's a great question. And I've had similar discussions with people before. And I think it's a really valid concern because it is true that, like, these tests are low fidelity. They don't take a lot of precise information. they don't take a lot of precise information. You don't get a lot of precise information on the products and materials used quite often because manufacturers often don't give out that information or maybe it's not been tested. I mean, in my work, it was sort of quite opportunistic. It's trying to learn what you can learn from what you have but also i think there's this whole element between what are we looking what currently engineers do at fire engineers doing when they like have to make these assessments they're also kind of looking at like oh i have this product in this location this thing in this location quite often what they're looking for is they're just looking for some insight into oh if i tested this setup or if i tested this setup with these kind of products, you know, what would the outcome be across different tests? You know, the point is currently the only way of testing that is by looking at a test and you can't like make a new one. You can't learn from all the previous ones that have happened. whereas you know it may be that at the moment with this kind of low fidelity you can't say oh my precise facade with these precise materials will reach a height a flame height of this height on the building and you'll have this much time but what i can tell you is oh it'll do this badly in this test and then from that from learning from the past and sort of predicting how it's going to behave in these tests you can already make some judgments and you can make some judgments before you go on you know it's sort of a tool to assist engineers it's not a tool to tell you your facade is safe or your facade is not safe using this data is you know assisting people giving people more information with which to make judgments. Because, as I say, it's still super complex, and we're not at the point where our tools can be used without sort of human judgment. But, yeah, coming back to the test method, how do you think that the setup limits the capability to do science with that? I think what became interesting when we did our own experiments the temperature measurements useful as they were were actually much less useful than just the video footage of the experiments because looking at the whole thing lets you spot all these things where like you say because fire is so complex if you've just got temperature measurements at one location you can try and build around that location but it's not a sort of you know fire isn't a homogenous thing it's quite inhomogeneous and therefore having sort of that overall view is very important to know how something did in the test um and yeah and why also i think what you're saying about regulations it's why it's important not to just look at the, they give us a pass fail criteria for standardization. But one of the things in my thesis was that I didn't want the analysis to be on the pass fail criteria because they say they're very dependent on the regulations. Whereas measurements during the test, they're still going to be biased by the country and by the way people build stuff and all of this sort of thing, and dependent on how the test is run. But between these tests, they should be consistent. You know, they're objective measurements as opposed to just, oh, this is related to regulations. You know, a flame height is a flame height. Unless you change the gravity. That's true. Yeah, but when you say it like that, I mean, it's kind of obvious. To believe that you can place a single thermocouple and capture the complexity of flame behavior inside a cavity, and yet we just place a thermocouple, yeah, that's a cavity temperature. Well, it's quite similar with that with the Dalmarnock tests right where they had all the thermocouples in the mock-up compartment first of all it was very inhomogeneous right but also when they were trying to get people to predictively model how that was going to end up you know it was really really hard to model it even the average temperature behavior um or the fire growth because there's so many different factors to keep into account and i think like that same complexity comes in just sticking some thermocouples in there it's not going to tell you a lot what it can help to do is to give you further information on addition to the camera once you could also have visual behavior to back it up the temperatures then is possible to say like oh that's probably why that's got a spike there or why that doesn't have a spike there you know whereas when you're just seeing all these spikes out of nowhere it's like well that could be for any number of reasons and you know the fire could be doing any number of things at this point yeah one thing that is in here, I always have the trouble, because many people usually try to flatten this whole discussion into a material issue. Like, I mean, your facade is combustible, so it's going to burn down. And I think I understand that the complexity is not only at the material. I understand that the complexity is not only at the material. Like, I can probably design a very non-combustible facade that would be very dangerous with the knowledge I have. And if I can do it by intention, there's someone who can do it by accident, right? And, I mean, what's your take on the material versus system? Yeah, I mean, to be fair, in my thesis, I do mention a lot of the things I'm changing to do with the materials and the facade. And I think the reason is, and the reason we often talk about materials, is because they do obviously make a big difference. If you don't have any materials that can support flame spread, it's going to support combustion. It's going to make it much harder to design a dangerous facade. You know, like you say, there are ways to do it, but it does make it more difficult. And I think the thing is, what we're talking about before with the complexity of it, from our point of view view from like the you know it's from people who just want fire safety um it's the obvious solution it's the kind of well let's just remove those variables um and then because i can't i can't understand currently the problem is too complex for me to say that's definitely safe or definitely not safe or even what scenarios it's safe in and what scenarios it's not safe in we're not really confident in that i think at the moment um and that's why people uh want to keep it a material issue however obviously these materials have huge advantages uh in a lot of in a lot of areas um and a lot of them are important, like energy efficiency, sustainability, and all this sort of stuff. But also just in terms of, for a lot of architects, it's just really important to make beautiful buildings. And I think that is an important part of human life, is that we don't want all our buildings to be ugly or just functional. So that's good too. The thing is, obviously, that's not worth paying the price of someone's life for. And that's where we come into this thing of how can we use these materials safely? It's a really, once you start thinking about things that like the scale of the entirety of humanity, it gets very, very difficult to um to work out those decisions on when you can use stuff or not and i think that complexity is why you go down to just like okay just don't use combustible materials and we can feel pretty sure that we'll be safe but obviously it's a very. I'm not sure if you can call it conservative. Yeah, maybe you can in terms of facade and combustible materials. What's your take on the direction where we're heading? Because, I mean, this all started, I don't know when, maybe 20 years ago, when we started to introduce these complex facade systems. And nowadays, like every building you see has this complex facade. It truly changed the system, the way how the facades are built, the way how building envelope is constructed. You can see the buildings growing and they immediately have the facade put on place and it's usually a very complex system that are brought from a factory and being just assembled on the site. So it takes a lot of complexity from the assembly point of view and the number of these solutions is growing exponentially. And I can imagine in countries like UK or in the Middle East, like possibly all new buildings will have these complex facades. So the problem is yet unsolved. So where are we heading? Are we creating more trouble while doing that? Or is there any way we can limit that while doing that? Yeah. Well, that's a really good question. And I certainly am going to preface this with that i don't know the answer but i guess that um some things i've been thinking i've been thinking about during it that sort of come into uh my head is um like you say i don't think people i don't think the industry is just gonna stand stand by. And when I say the industry, I just mean construction in general around the world is not going to suddenly stop using any combustible material because they are reusable. And, you know, we want to start using wood and we want to start using, building more and more interesting structures. We will also not start removing cavities from facades. And when the renovation wave hits, I think double-skin facades will be one of the ways to truly improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings. So I only think it will grow. So what to do? Yeah. And I think the thing is the number of these kind of facade fires are growing over time. number of these kind of facade fires are growing over time but there's been so far like there have been some really disastrous fires uh grainfield being the most noticeable example but it's usually not just the facade in that issue there's like a number of other fire issues in that building as well and i think what you also notice is a lot of those buildings are buildings that were built quite cheaply and with a lot of cost cutting and stuff involved along the way. Maybe that's a personal judgment. I can't say that's true all the time. I'm sure you can find exceptions, all of that sort of thing. But I do think in the future, if we're like, you know, maybe the time to sort of think of stuff at the material level and just like say, don't use combustibles is when you're already trying to cut costs elsewhere it's like okay if you're if you're not paying attention to the level of complexity involved in this we need to think of stuff at a simpler level and just like don't use combustible materials but if you're going to spend a lot of time making sure everything's fabricated fabricated perfectly and all the cavity barriers in place and everything's being put together to a really, really high standard, then maybe you can, and also that the other layers of fire protection are backing up, so you've got plenty of evacuation, you've got suppression, all this stuff, then maybe you can, you know, accept the increased risk. I think you touched a very difficult topic for fire safety, You touched a very difficult topic for fire safety because even though there's usually one person that pays the bill for building the building or refurbishing the building, the work is usually sliced down into packages, mechanical and building envelope package, structural package. You usually have different stakeholders doing different things. And I'm afraid you would more often, rather than finding people who would take additional precautions because others failed, I think you'd rather find like, okay, we can not do that so others can do something more. And these people would not like to do something more. So it's very difficult to organize the safety holistically for the whole building. And I think we had quite good success with codes and standards being put in place as a matter of presenting the solutions that work or are acceptable. We recognize that the codes and standards fail every now and then. And they definitely cannot predict the future and proactively prevent from disasters in future because we don't know what will happen. So in your work, you've taken the data from our lab and you've magically found some relations between them, assigned these new indexes, found unbiased methods. I was already very impressed with that. But when I took your PhD in my hand, I was really surprised you'd taken it further and introduced a new player, namely the machine learning. And can you tell me a bit more what the machine has found in my tests that I have missed? Yeah, I mean, I think this is where things get really tricky, right? With the machine learning stuff is because so basically we trained a sort of neural network on my thesis will be out soon very hopefully. If it's live before the podcast, I'll drop a link. And if it's later, I'll update. So keep your eyes on the show notes. But we trained like, so the inputs for the model was sort of like these different materials in the facade and the properties of those materials. So like the thermal conductivity of the cladding, the heat of combustion of the cladding, and similarly for the insulation. Or, I mean, they weren't all also the type of facade. They weren't all rain screen facades. Some of them were ethics facades. Some of them were sandwich panel facades. And they had like, and also like, say, cavity width was something being included, or whether or not there was a cavity. These were all fed into the model. And also importantly, because there were also different standards involved, like it wasn't just data from your lab. There was also some data from other labs. And so we also had an input as to what kind of test was used. Was it a Polish test british test or the american test and feeding all this into the model it could then try to predict what was the maximum flame height in the test and what was the peak temperature measured during the test because each of these standards kind of measures the overlap of what they measured was the peak flame height and the temperature. Obviously, it's a bit weird because the peak flame height in the Polish one is always capped. Similarly with the tallest ones, the British one can go higher than the other ones. But that's why that standard was an input to these things. And the output, the prediction of this on blind data, the prediction of this model was like about 80%, 85% sort of accurate. And the thing is, part of that accuracy for sure is going to be the fact that we used the subset of data we had was it's small by machine learning standards it's like only a few hundred couple of hundred examples and that for machine learning is not a huge amount and what that means is that this model might perform really well on the kind of data we have that might not generalize very well but the good thing about these kind of models is you can just feed it more and more data to make it more general. As for what it was capturing, I think the thing is exactly what we're saying there about all these elements that we don't think about, they might be biases. Certain materials might be correlated with certain performance or certain, you know, cavities might be like, oh, that's a cavity width they use when they're experimenting rather than a cavity width they use on a real building, something like that. These are all things that might pick up as well as just the fire behavior. And that's the thing. It's not like it is a black box. It's not going to tell you why it predicts stuff well. But the idea is if you make the data large enough and include enough examples, you've then got something that can very robustly tell you how it's going to perform in these different tests when you give it a facade. And that's kind of what you want to be able to do. in these different tests when you give it a facade. And that's kind of what you want to be able to do. You want to be able to learn from past results, you know, which is something I think that currently we can't do very well. I mean, you're British and I don't want to torture you, but if I had a choice between a desktop study and the machine learning, I would pick the machine learning for some reason. I mean, the weakness is obviously it cannot predict things that it has not seen ever. Well, maybe it can figure out some relations on a big enough data set. But, for example, if you train it only on ethics facades and then you show the cavity, it will not know what's happening and it will have very little time predicting. But then again, I think it's a very – the power in it lies with the fact that you're taking the intermediate results of the tests, not the pass-fail criteria itself. I mean, if I ask – if I make a survey in my lab with 10 people who test these facades, so they're actually well-trained biological machine learning algorithms. And I show them, like, look at this facade. Will it pass or fail? They can pretty accurately tell what will be the outcome, perceived outcome of the test. But if I ask them what will be the peak excess temperature, no way. And then, and this methods can really shine. I would like to move back a bit because we've mentioned that you've mentioned about these criteria that are not the pass-fail criteria. I think you've mentioned the peak excess temperature and flame heights. Could you tell us a bit more how these were conceived and introduced in your studies? Tell us a bit more how these were conceived and introduced in your studies. Yeah, so in my studies, we needed sort of ways to take the results from these tests into a way that could be easily analyzed across a large number of examples. So the thing about a temperature time curve is that it's got a lot, it's very data heavy. So, you know, there's a lot of trends that you could pick out of that and you've got to find a way of collapsing that into something that can be compared across a lot of things um this is something that's quite commonly done actually you notice that in like the euro class standards they have uh what is it figra and smogra and all this sort of thing and they're similar ideas of like a value to represent what a curve looks like. So the ones we looked at, we looked at peak flame height, because that is something that all the tests are looking at anyway, at least the ones that we, in all the standards we were looking at, kind of their key criteria was how high the flame went. That was one of their key things they were measuring. So that was very easy to use. And the other thing, they were all taking temperatures. So we looked at the peak temperature to start off with because that seemed like sort of the most critical, like how high does the temperature get, seemed to us one of the most important values when looking at temperatures. Like a local maximum of temperature during the test. Exactly, yeah. And then the reason we added this excess rather than just saying peak temperature is because obviously all of these tests, I say obviously, all of these different standards are measuring temperature at a different height and also from a different fire source to begin with so the idea of this excess temperature was to work out oh if we if we take the base value so excess temperature is usually used uh related to ambient temperature like room temperature in this case we're saying like oh if the ambient temperature is like um the the temperature where you just did a test without a facade where it was just the fire what would be that ambient temperature and so the excess is like how high did it go above that temperature during the test um that was the that was the idea um of what we were trying to get obviously it's not a like it's an indicative variable rather than like a precise variable it wouldn't be something you would measure in a lab to be like tell you something about the material behavior but it's a good one for like analyzing all this kind of relative behavior or at least we hope it's a good one analyzing all this relative behavior across all these facades like which ones did better or worse you know and sort of being able to rank that quantitatively yeah yeah i i think i think that was one of the better ideas in in the research to to figure out if there are these uh different ways you can quantify these uh results because just comparing the temperatures doesn't say anything. Like if you say in Polish method the temperature was 400 degrees, but in NFPA it was 600. You have no idea if that's the method facade or the way how it was measured. And standardizing this against the biases of the method is quite interesting. And actually when you've done that in the database paper, looking through the facades and using these measures to filter out the, let's say, dangerous ones or to filter out which would have this higher perceived flammability index, I think it was called back then. It was quite successful because we've picked up the ACPs, the HPLs. I mean, even if you had no idea about the structure of these materials from this database, you could see these ones for some reason are the dangerous ones. And in reality, in the real world, we also observe that. It's the same types of facades we see in the news when we're thrilled with the fact that there has been a huge fire. We also did a funny thing. When we finished our research, we realized that there was a lot of bias in this data set introduced by the fact that it was based on a Polish method. It's a representation of Polish facades, you know, in a way, right, which are biased by the way how this method is used in Poland for 30 years. And we found these blank spots on some solutions that could potentially be used elsewhere in the world, like UK or Middle East. And we've actually built them and we've burned them, which has been a great experience. And I wanted to ask you, like, we've burned like 20 facades, ventilated and unventilated with different types of claddings, HPL Class B, Class C. We had two types of ACP panels. We had some very simple setups with, like, just mineral wool covered with non-combustible boards. And we had these crazy ventilated facades that were perceived as very dangerous. facades that were perceived as very dangerous. And I mean, it's obviously very interesting to discuss the intrinsic differences between the tests. But I was wondering if there was anything that really surprised you while doing this 20 experiments. Like, what was the shocker for you? I have one. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm interested to hear your one. But for me, I think the biggest surprise was just the effect of removing the cavity. So I think you're saying we'd use ventilated and ventilated facades, but I think what was unique about these experiments was that we didn't just try real facades that were ventilated and some different styles of facades. We took the same ventilated facade and just put the cladding directly against the insulation. And so there wasn't a cavity anymore. And it was the same material composition, right? It was the same... Yeah, same material composition. And it made such a huge difference to the fire behavior. It really slowed down the flame spread. In one of the cases, it actually allowed the facade to self-extinguish, whereas before it was really, really on fire. And then in this one, it went out, basically, or it went to smoldering, at least. The contrast between that behavior was really surprising. For me, the biggest surprise was the fires that we've made were not really large. I mean, when you observe them, they were huge. They were scary. I think one of the first ones we just extinguished very soon after ignition because we were scared. It was such a huge fire. But as we've grown to be familiar with these fires and we turned off this biased thinking about what fire is, what's a big fire, I've come to the realization that these fires are not that big. And I've come to the realization that these fires are not that big. Obviously, the minus of the hood, we do not have oxygen calorimetry in it, which is a shame. We could not quantify that. But from the perceived dose of heat accumulated by my skin, I can tell you. I mean, sophisticated biological heat flux measurements. But these fires were not huge. I mean, I could approach the facade from fairly close distance. I could observe it from fairly close distance. And I've done many of these experiments in my lab in this hood, and I've used gas burners with known mass flow rate. So actually we've done that on the second day of our experiments where we played with the cavities and we've run these experiments with half megawatt, one megawatt, two megawatts of fire in a very similar setting. And I remember when we did this one and a half megawatt, I really felt it from like 10 meters that there's a one and a half megawatt. Well, when we were burning facades, I mean, these fires were huge when you looked at them from the front. But I don't think that the heat release rate was that tremendously big. And we'll jump into the visual method. But I think you actually quantified that. And it correlates to the feeling of my skin. And what I want to say, I mean, from one side, it's really interesting and exciting that these fires are smaller than you would expect, which I would expect. So that makes me happier because if a fire is smaller, then maybe it's less threat. But on the other hand, the temperatures that we've measured, the damage done to the facade, the scale of destruction brought by these fairly little fires was astounding. If you consider that it was just, let's say, 500 kilowatts or 300 kilowatts that destroyed this big sample, created temperatures in cavity in range of 1,000 centigrade. And we had flame extensions for like two and a half meter above that. That's kind of frightening, you know, because it means it doesn't have to a huge fire to be huge for the facade. That's my point. You don't have to have 20 megawatts venting on your facade to create conditions that are immediately dangerous to the facade itself. So that was kind of my shocker that, I mean, these fires were not as big in terms of heat release or or size i mean they were two-dimensional in the end in a in a way yeah yeah i i agree with that the reason they build these facades is because they're very thin and lightweight and it did mean that the fire was kind of restricted to these kind of very thin regions of burning, which is why from the front, if you just look to that, you're like, wow, that's a big fire. But from the side, it's like, oh, that's not such a big fire. From my perspective, it was like from the front, it was like, I think we should extinguish that. And from the side, it was, can I stick myhone inside the cavity and survive which i kind of did and yeah not not during the test we were allowed it didn't ruin the experimental results thanks no no but but there's a thing it is like kind of it's kind of two-dimensional which is in a way fascinating because that's another high behavior you would not normally consider. Like you are not learned about this in a school. What was interestingly three-dimensional, though, which wasn't really planned for the experiments because we hadn't really talked about how to make the facades really flush like you would, you might in a normal test, you know or you might in a real building you'd have the insulation the cladding and the fixing and the external wall as like a flush piece of material in this we'd accidentally created a channel between like the it's hard to explain without a photo but it's like we had the brick wall uh and then the cladding and then we had sort of this side channel where there was like the insulation and we thought that's fine because that's just the side of the facade but during the test because like the wind blows the fire about in a couple of the tests uh that channel ignited and it just went right up because it was in a channel. It really, it was unexpected flame spread behavior that was quite three-dimensional because it was in a level that we hadn't really considered as like we were imagining this sort of 1D problem. What you mentioned are the vertical separations we've introduced by building the structure of the facade, yes? Yeah, yeah, exactly. building the structure of the facade, yes? Yeah, yeah, exactly. That was fascinating to see how it separated into sections that could burn rather independently from each other. Often simultaneously, but there were some differences between that. That was definitely very, very interesting. And we've also used like combustible, non-combustible insulation materials and I mean there was there were these combinations that included combustible materials which I mean looking at the whole project didn't end that badly right and we also had ventilated facades with non-combustible panels and that led to significant damage of the panels in the experiment. And, I mean, it may not be that dangerous in terms of spread of fire, but the damage to the facade did exist in this test. So I think it was another statement of complexity versus materials in the experiment itself. Yeah, the debris from the we were using cement board it was basically spalling right yeah it's throwing a lot of it was raining yeah which would be interesting whether that would be like it's the sort of thing where you would it be a risk i mean they wouldn't use just a cement board i imagine rain screen cladding but yeah i there was that sort of complexity and also the complexity of like in one of the tests i guess in a lot in in the test was sort of flab or cladding it was kind of like the insulation the cladding it was hard to just separate you know where one's burning and one's not or anything like that that was part of the difficulty of analyzing these results but in the test where we had the cement board and then uh foam insulation um there that you were getting this sort of smoldering going on in the in the cavity right and it it was slow but it was like definitely spreading the smoldering through the facade it was burning for all you know we left it for however long it was 45 minutes and it was just still um still going and interestingly it was then igniting at the top of the cavity like so as soon as all this gas met some oxygen at the top it was like like then catching fire. So it was definitely hot enough to be burning in there, but there wasn't enough oxygen getting in, which is interesting. There's definitely a lot of interesting things happening when you burn these things in full scale and you always learn something new and somewhat unexpected. I've also really enjoyed the way how the data processing was performed. I found the method of estimating the heat release rate from cameras quite impressive and astounding, to be honest. And I think the audience would love to hear about that idea because it's uh it's really powerful uh you've called it the visual heat release rate and what you did is like you've estimated the value of the heat release rate based on on the volume calculations on the flame can you say something more about that yeah so we called it the visual firepower and the idea i i think it was when we were just in the fire dynamics textbook they're mentioning oh you know volume is correlated with heat release rate in a turbulent fire um and then again i was like oh you could investigate that and so i did look into some more research um and yeah there's this paper by derise and Orloff where they're sort of going like, oh, well, in a pool fire, if you do through modelling and you correlate the flame height to the diameter and then assume it's this shape, then the volume will be proportional to the heat release rate. But then there's also been, there was then some work done in 2003 and 2005 by these guys mason and stratton and michael spearpoint i think was overseeing it trying to do it with cameras um and basically trying to do the same thing of like estimating volume use that to estimate heat release rate um and we were like oh let's try and do that that sounds very useful but i'm like kind of the work they'd done was very sort of the beginning of it and they hadn't provided code that i could use um and the methods they had were like way too uh time time slow for like it was it would have taken me weeks to run experiments just using the sort of explanation they've given obviously they might have done some stuff when they actually did it themselves i don't know i could i didn't ask them um so i just sort of developed this uh sort of different method for um but inspired by that to try and measure this heat release rate or estimate it by by measuring the volume of the flame um so by using these two orthogonal cameras to estimate the flame surface averaged over time and i think that's the key thing in all of these examples it's a it's a time averaged volume and the reason for that and i was talking about this with guillermo um because we about it. Because the thing is, the reason why volume is correlated with flame height is, to be honest, a little bit of other than this Froude modeling explanation. There's one other paper on a theoretical explanation, which, to be honest, I didn't understand because it was very high level fluid mechanics. You don't get that as a physicist. We don't do a lot of fluid mechanics. And it's talk about like Rayleigh's Taylor instability criterion or something. But essentially, the heat release rate should be more to do with the surface area of the flame. Right. That's where the reaction is happening. The problem is, how do you work out the... Where's the surface area of the flame? And so I think that's the key thing, is if you time average it over a long enough period of time, that's going to... for a turbulent flame, that random behavior is kind of going to average over to the volume that you see as like that flaming region. That makes sense. Nature is very efficient and nature would not create a shape with very bad surface to volume ratio. It will tend to self-optimize in a way. And what you say that it's surface where the burning is happening that's obviously true i know that because i've sticked my iphone into inside of the flame and it was hollow inside yeah i i confirmed that by by by throwing an iphone through a campfire in a slow-mo um so i i think it's very fascinating because you're pretty much taking a fairly easy thing to set up before the experiment, and I meant visuals, cameras, and can create a powerful output, which is some sort of evolution of the heat release rate over time. And by simple, I mean it's very robust. To create a good measurement of temperature, you need to know where do you expect your flows to happen. And believe me, countless times I faced the issue of trying to measure a fire phenomenon just to figure out it happened 20 centimeters to the left. And my measurements need to be repeated once again. And with the video that covers a larger part of your assembly, it's robust to do that. That's really powerful. If we have some few minutes left, I really wanted to ask you about your future plans, If we have some few minutes left, I really wanted to ask you about your future plans. Because, I mean, the PhD is great and everything, but what's the next step in the facade research? Or are you switching back to physics because the fire is not working? Yeah, no, we did. We've got a project we're working on at the moment, which is why I'm still at Imperial. That's what got this post-op funding to do this project. It's essentially, we call the project Bridged, which is after the Celtic god of fire, goddess of fire. That wasn't my choice this time um but it's a but it's a fun name and the idea is it's like um to compare different um different standards so what we're talking earlier about like the fact that all these stand all these facades test standards uh use different kinds of fires and different facade setups um and different failure criteria and all this sort of thing. It's a bit of a minefield in terms of like. If you ask trying to ask why people do things their way, everyone's got a different answer. And, you know, a lot of people just think, oh, well, if we do my test, the facade is that if I pass this test, it's safe. If I don't, if I, you know, or other people are thinking, well, why do I have to use this test when this one is cheaper? You know, there's all these people. People have a lot of opinions, but there isn't a lot of data available to actually back up these opinions. There's not really any experimental series comparing the same facades across different test methods and so that's what we're doing we're doing five different facades across five different test methods and we're just testing the same facades same setup on these five different methods and we're just going to see what happens we're going to take measurements with our cameras again. We're going to add thermocouples and we're just going to, you know, try and look at the, not the pass fail criteria. I mean, we might do some analysis of it, but like really with, we're just trying to see is the behavior, do these tests consistently rank, you know,ades so if we have facades at different levels of or expected levels of flammability do they come up with similar uh similar ranks across all these different standards or do they have completely different behavior in these different scenarios um i don't know which one included in this be yes the Polish one is included I'm scared now I'm scared now because our it's actually at the same time scary and fascinating because it's scary because our method is probably the smallest one and I'm not certainly sure how the scale will affect the outcome like if it's possible for a facade to pass our test because it was not big enough to combust and fail, maybe a larger facade of the same material has this critical mass, let's say. If you can say that, maybe it will behave differently. On the other hand, it's kind of fascinating. If all of them are ranking the things in the same manner, then why use 9-meter test when you could do that with 2-meter? Exactly. Or maybe you could use a smaller facade to screen the solutions in a way. I mean, it's a fascinating idea, and I hope it will be a great piece of science. It's certainly very, very interesting. Yeah. At the very least, I think what we hope from the outcome is it will at least allow, because I think there's a lot of discussions going on now, definitely in the UK, about what to do about facade tests, what to do about facades in general and what uh you know and they're harmonizing the european standards all this sort of thing i'm hoping at least the experiments help to contribute to that discussion with some you know with some data that isn't opinionated but you know we don't have an agenda behind the data we just want to see what happens. That's cool. I think that would be good. And you're using the new designed European method or not? Well, no, because I think it's not been fully, not 100% released yet, right? I think it's still discussed at the moment, but it's heavily based on the British and the German methods, and both of those methods are included. Although it won't be the exact European one. The European one is definitely under development. I mean, it's a great idea to have a harmonized standard for the facades. Okay, man. I think I've reached the limits of your generosity with time. I still have some questions left on my list, but let's leave them for a follow-up interview. There will be a part two. Definitely. When you burn all of these facades, I will definitely love to welcome you back in the show to discuss if, again, there was something shocking that you have found. If people want to learn more about your research and your research group, where should they seek information? That's a great question. If you want to look up our research group, Imperial Hayes Lab, you can find us online um we've got a imperial college slash hayes lab i think it's the web page but you can just google it and that works too uh if you want to follow my research in particular i've got linkedin twitter research gate uh that's matt bonafire on all of those things or matthew bonafire maybe on linkedin i'll put it in show notes so people can track you but yeah you can find my links there and if you want specific stuff yeah feel free to email me if you just google matthew bonner imperial college you can find my contact details and um like at imperial like my Imperial email. And I'm happy to answer questions. I'd love to. Or if you've got suggestions, please throw them at me too. That's fantastic, Mike. Thank you so much for agreeing to do that. I hope you enjoyed. I've enjoyed it a lot, and I'm sure the audience will really like what you had to say on the Facade Fires. And yeah, all the best, man. Thanks. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for having me. It's been great fun. Yeah, I hope you enjoyed this episode. And, yeah, Matt is a great guy, and I really like working with him and discussing facade problems with him. In this episode, we've touched so many different aspects of the safety of facades from the way how we test the facades through seeking knowledge inside some tests that have been already done, touching so many aspects of complexity of facade fires and the back door, the kitchen of how we are doing the facade tests and actually how this, the way how we do them is reflected in the structure of modern facades. That's actually astounding. And there will be a follow-up with Matt, definitely. And there will be a follow-up with Matt, definitely, as he just told you. The Imperial is planning a new series of experiments with five types of facades. And the good news is that we may be doing it with them. So that makes me very happy. I'm always looking forward to run some large-scale experiments with interesting people. So, yeah, thank you for being here and listening to this episode.
