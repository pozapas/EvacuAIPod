 Hello everybody, welcome to the Fire Science Show. It has been quite a long time since we last had an episode about battery fires and the batteries have not went anywhere, they're still in the focus of interest of the fire safety community. So yeah, about the time to fix this and I have a battery episode for you. This time I have invited Dr. Adam Barowy from UL FSRI, whose expertise is in testing e-mobility devices, hoverboards, scooters, and batteries used in such types of devices, but also in storage systems, in energy storage systems, residential energy storage systems. And of course, as a part of ULFSRI, he has excellent experience in fire testing these things in various interesting setups, including residential setups, garages, and similar. risks related to battery systems, but we haven't really placed them within the environment of a residential unit or a civilian garage that really changes the fire dynamics and really changes the risks related to batteries. This episode is also a way for me to atone for my little fear-mongering I've done in Poland related to the risks of e-mobility devices and fires of Poland related to the risks of immobility devices and fires of such. So there's a lot of knowledge, a lot of information in here that helps you understand when such a device is used safely, operated safely, and when it's not, and how to protect yourself, what's your best chances to do when you have such a device, and generally understand what are the hazards related to such fires. And I am the last thing standing between you and this great episode, so let's move me away, let's spin the intro and jump into the episode. Welcome to the Firesize Show. My name is Wojciech Wigrzyński and I will be your host. This podcast is produced in partnership with OFR Consultants, a multi-award winning UK-based fire and risk consultancy. OFR are supporting a number of PhDs at universities around the UK, including Edinburgh and Sheffield. And the one I would like to highlight today is the opportunity at the Fire Safety Engineering Group at the University of Greenwich. This PhD is about how can we harness the power of BIM in our engineering practice. You may recall episode 62 about BIM. It seems like a promising, useful tool, and any development in that is much welcome for the FHIR community. The PhD will use computational tools like FHIR models and evacuation tools, and will examine the data exchange requirements for them to be used together in one digital workflow employing BIM. If you would like to participate in this fully funded PhD bursary, please check the episode show notes. You can find more information linked to the application. Important thing is the date. It's closing on 28th February 2023. So yeah, please check it out. And now back to the episode with Adam. Hello, everybody. Welcome to Firescience Show. I'm today here with Adam Barove from ULFSRI. Hey, Adam, great to have you. Hello, Vojta. Nice to meet you. I'm very happy to have you on the show. And the topic of today's discussion is lithium-ion batteries. I've been told there's no other person in the world that has burned as many batteries as you. I wonder if that is true. But maybe let's start with how it began for you. When did you start burning batteries for a living? I was working at Underwriters Laboratory's Research and Development Group, which kind of handles all the different new and innovative type challenges that come to Underwriters Laboratories. The first types of products we started working on were hoverboards. There was kind of a overnight development of a hazard that arrived, I think, with the holidays. And hoverboards were gifted quite a lot. And so you all responded by doing some demonstrations of some of the potential hazards of hoverboards and then developing a product safety standard. When was that? Sorry. So that was about 2016. And these hoverboards are very disappointing. They don't hover at all. They have wheels. And I still haven't tried one myself. I saw some of the lab techs try them and I decided I need to protect my brains. Some of the lab techs try them and I decided I need to protect my brains. So, yeah, that was actually kind of interesting because we're sort of a general purpose fire research and development group. We tend to work on problems that I think I've seen you're more familiar with, like fire resistance, fire modeling and support of the business. But since we demonstrated some capability to know what we're doing in testing battery products, that led to more and more opportunities. And so I know that within the span of about three months in my own career, I went from working on a diverse set of topics to only testing batteries. And it had been that way for years, which has led to a lot of excitement. So what was so interesting in the hoverbirds as a fire threat? Was there a lot of incidents with them or it was just a new unknown that has appeared and no one knew what to do with them? Yeah, it was the rate of incidents that were occurring in North America that, you know, whether that's sensationalized or driven by the data, UL will respond to that and make an effort to sort of tie up that safety gap. And so what we were seeing, in fact, one of the technicians in my group is a part-time firefighter nearby. And the very week that we started working on hoverboards, he responded to a house fire where a single mother had given her son's hoverboards for Christmas. And about 3 a.m., one of them was charging and went into thermal runaway. And the specific hazard of those hoverboards was that when the battery pack went into thermal runaway, the cells would tend to eject from the casing and sort of create like, you know, many fold ignition sources in one room. And so this amazing woman grabbed a fire extinguisher, a dry chemical fire extinguisher, and managed to chase all of these cells and put them out and stop her house from burning down. So it's this great case study very early on, but this is what was occurring. And so there really was no regulation or safety standards for hoverboards. And so that was an area where UL as a whole was able to respond pretty quickly and kind of close that safety gap. But before we started the show, I thought it'd be interesting. I took an inventory of all the lithium-ion products that I have in my own home, and I lost count at about 21. And so of those 21, there's varying degrees of safety. They're not all as well-developed as hoverboards. And I don't yet have any e-mobility devices, but they may come one day. as hoverboards. And I don't yet have any e-mobility devices, but they may come one day. And so I think that the really interesting thing is how many different types of products now that you find lithium ion batteries in. And where one type of product may have a lot of engineering around it and become much more safe, all of a sudden, new products where batteries didn't exist in them last year. Now they exist, and that industry does not have the institutional knowledge of other industries. So they're sort of back closer to zero in terms of safety. I had an episode of this podcast with Anja Bullinghaus-Hoffmann, and she's working in Germany on fire safety of vehicles, of buses. And we were discussing how different the safety regulations for buses are from the train industry. Like, you would think it's very similar things in terms of interior of the vehicle and the material choices. I mean, mine is the drivetrain and the trucks, it's the same thing, essentially. And yet, the differences are vast. Like, two completely different industries with two completely different sets of standards. I guess in the world of lithium-ion batteries, it's the same. Some products are investigated, safeguarded, certified, and have to go through a very painful route of being approved to the market and go on. And I guess from this, you could expect a higher safety margin. And for some of this, it's just another battery. Like in your flashlight, for example. I have a flashlight with lithium-ion single cell. It's a massive, massive cell. And I'm not sure if there's any safety in this flashlight. And I would never expect very significant engineering. But then if I see a video of this type of cell being crushed or you know needled through with needle it is a significant fire threat so out of these 21 items you have at your home which of those you would feel are at this higher end of safety and which you think are maybe overlooked? Well I know for certain what's at the higher end of safety and which you think are maybe overlooked? Well, I know for certain what's at the higher end of safety. I've got a battery in my motorcycle that I know has been pretty rigorously tested. It replaces the lead acid battery, and I know that they put it through abuse testing because of the relatively abusive environment of an off-road motorcycle. And then other very popular consumer electronics. So we know that the cell phone industry, for example, has suffered a lot of bad publicity from previous battery incidents. So those types of products, we know the quality control of the cells is much higher. Where I think that things are probably a little less safe are rapidly developed products. So where you have something that maybe the company has not obviously been around for a while and may not obviously be around for a while, but they're sort of responding to this rapidly growing trend. So hoverboards were a great example. And now I think that New York City is an excellent example of how it's, I'll call them e-mobility devices or scooters. I know that there's a lot of conflict with calling them e-bikes because there's an industry that works around e-bikes, like pedal bikes, but with battery assist that works very hard on safety. And they're sort of separate from these more like delivery service oriented vehicles. Yes, that's something that we talk about a lot lately, these e-mobility devices. Everyone was focusing a lot on the vehicles like cars, car parks, cars on roads, cars in tunnels, all aspects of how vehicles, how they behave in fires. And it also was in a way driven by the media attention. There was a lot of media around that at some point. I feel that the turmoil is still there, but I think we're all a little bit more comfortable with these types of vehicles. I mean, we're learning them for sure. And I also have this feeling that people are working on engineering them better. them for sure. And I also have this feeling that people are working on engineering them better. Now, these e-bikes, these e-mobility devices, for me, they start to be forefront of threats related to lithium-ion batteries or electromobility in general, because people store them in their houses. Like when I contemplate the of an electric vehicle in a car park, I mean, a car park is a fairly well-prepared place to host the fire. They're usually secure. If it's a large car park, they would have some detection systems, ventilation systems, maybe sprinklers. They provide access and stuff like that. They're not full of people. I mean, it's obviously a very bad thing to have a fire in a car park, but that's not the worst place to have a fire after all. And your living room is certainly a much worse place to have a fire. So you mentioned you had some experiences with your firefighters that would work with you. I know UL is a very firefighter-oriented institution that works with firefighters a lot. During your work on the batteries from these smaller devices, what were their views, the firefighters' views on this? Does this really change the firefighting environment? Yeah, it does, in fact. I was thinking of all sorts of really exciting things I wanted to talk about as you kind of went through that intro here. But one of the things that I think that we really need to do at FSRI that we're starting to do, he has covered the fundamentals of how hazards develop from lithium ion battery thermal runaways. And so when we were talking earlier, that's what I meant by I'm finding the need to widen the scope of what we're studying, away from specifically e-mobility or specifically energy storage and get more into the fundamentals on how hazard scenarios develop from that. And so if you've seen our Web page more recently, we just posted a project that's ongoing and it says it's about residential energy storage system explosion hazards and garages. But you won't see very many batteries in that test. We're releasing flammable gas that represents what comes out of a battery in thermal runaway. And so that really is independent of what type of battery pack it comes from. And so what we're trying to do with that type of research is better understand what size of battery pack will it take for fire dynamics to change inside a residential compartment. So, yes, some of the tests that we ran in June, we represented fuel loads inside a garage by just using group A commodity that you would use for sprinkler testing, plastic and cardboard. And then we included some tests with batteries and tests without batteries. And so we had baseline performance of an underventilated compartment fire. We simulate fire department arrival. We simulate the ventilation that they perform, including some, it was really, really fun. We used pyrotechnics to simulate the sparking that the saw would create and going through the door. And then in the case, the baseline case, sort of what I think most firefighters are going to expect to arrive to. We simulate this cutting through the door and there's an underventilated compartment fire. It takes about 10 minutes with the size ventilation we've created to get to a condition like flashover. In the tests that we included batteries, what we did was we started fire inside the commodity. We let that develop into an underventilated compartment fire. And then we forced thermal runaway in the batteries just to get this contribution of unburned flammable gas coming out of these cells in a low oxygen condition and changing the flammability of that gas layer. And so then when we simulate this saw operation with parking, we saw immediately that the smoke coming out around the edges of the garage door lit on fire. And as the vent is pulled open, the fire just immediately responds and gets much, much larger. And in one of those cases, when we simulated thermal runaway without starting a commodity fire, we managed to get a deflagration. So there was enough buildup of flammable gas from these thermal runaways. And we got a deflagration that kind of damaged our garage door and it sent a smoke plume about 70 feet horizontally across the lab. So that was part one of this big project that we've been running. And part two was we actually went and built a residential garage with real construction because we wanted to find out if that type of deflagration happened again, what would happen in a real residential structure? How would the hazards develop? Was the garage door going to come flying off and down the driveway? Or are the walls going to bow out and potentially injure a firefighter that's doing a size up of the incident? So there's a lot of really fascinating details around that. That project is essentially focused on how do fire dynamics of residential structure fires change if there's battery packs involved and how much battery pack has to be involved for that to happen. Deflagration is not a scenario I would consider for a home or for residential fire very often, unless I have some gas sources. So that's definitely a massive difference in the play field. So in your tests, it was both the battery was the primary item, like you run thermal runaway and burn the batteries and see how the fire grows from that point, but also a secondary item, like it lies there and there's a fire happening around it. And what happens? Was it only in like garage settings? My biggest concern is when people are not living in single unit households, they live in some sort of apartment buildings, you know, many flats around. You don't have the comfort of having a separate room to keep your mobility devices. And you would still like to charge your scooter for the next day. So you bring it home with you, like to the kitchen, to the residential room. Have you tried anything like that? Yes, actually. I was in the midst of moving when we ran these tests, so I was unfortunately not able to attend. So FSRI ran some tests in the fall of 2022. And we have ranch-style houses, which are pretty popular in North America but they they approximate the rough volume of a New York City apartment might be a bigger apartment but we ran a case where there was a closed bedroom with an e-bike and we ran another case where e-bike is sort of between the front door and the living space if you were in like a high-rise apartment it might be between the living space and the exit we talked deflagrations, but when we were setting up these tests, we were not necessarily expecting deflagrations. We just put the instrumentation there to be able to measure the pressure rise if we had them. But in actually both of the first two tests, we had deflagrations that blew the windows out. And this was from thermal runaway going through the battery pack very quickly and releasing unburned gas. And you would get this mixture of gas and vapors that sort of enveloped the e-bike. Maybe the cloud volume is about the size of an overstuffed chair, but when that ignites, it still produced enough pressure to rupture the building envelope. So it's really remarkable. And those are tests that we force. But back to this battalion chief I was talking to yesterday, he mentioned off the cuff when we were talking about this research that he'd recently run an incident where a homeowner was charging their scooter in a closet underneath their basement stairs. So it was behind a closed door. And when that scooter went into a run runaway, caused that closet to explode. And so the homeowner thought that someone was trying to break into the house. So he ran to his basement. You know, this is North America. So with his handgun to stop who was breaking into his house and discovered the fire and evacuated everyone safely. But so we know these incidents are happening. I guess I'll save the details, but we know of another incident where there was an explosion at a high-rise in New York City. They had really confused the arriving fire crews because they thought that there was a big open floor plan, but in reality, it had blown down an interior wall inside the apartment before their arrival. It is happening, and it is happening more with, you know, some products and others. So I think, you know, our focus is, as I mentioned, swinging towards the fundamentals and what we can do to address, especially for the fire service, what they can do about how these fundamental hazards are developing. So this type of deflagration or vapor cloud explosion scenarios, is this something you'd consider common in this type of battery applications? I assume the mechanism would be that the battery goes into thermal runaway, the cloud of vapor is released, and then eventually it gets ignited by the same source, by the thermal runaway or something. So you don't have this jet fire that we usually see with cars, but more like clouds that persist in explosion and then persist in fire, I would assume. Yeah, as we were talking about data earlier, it's hard to know how many of these incidents are happening. I have a short list of incidents where I suspect there was partial volume def know, leading to the outcome of the incident. But we are hearing about more of them. And so I think I would just say it's very likely to occur where you have an instance of a sufficiently large, maybe above one kilowatt hour battery pack where it goes into thermal runaway and releases gas without igniting. Because that gas and vapor mixture is kind of remarkable. igniting because that gas and vapor mixture is kind of remarkable. It does come out of the battery very hot, but it tends to linger around the source. And so when there is finally a competent ignition source presented by maybe sparks from the cell or something else nearby, it tends to ignite that local cloud and you get a can be a pretty significant partial volume deflagration. local cloud and you get a, can be a pretty significant partial volume deflagration. So I'm reluctant to call them common because I don't want to contribute to the fear of lithium ion batteries. But I think when you have this delayed ignition, they're always possible. It's a very challenging scenario because it also leads to significant change in the ventilation of the compartment. And that promotes flashover, easier growth of the fire. So that's very interesting. Given the size of these fires, like you've seen these fires. I've never seen an immobility device fire or one kilowatt, two kilowatt battery fire on my own. Actually, I saw it once, but it was not, that one was not massive. But you've seen that in a compartment setting. Is there much a person can do when such a fire goes on in their home? Is it possible to remove that device? Is it possible to take it over with household extinguishing media? Sadly, I don't think it's wise to advise anyone to try to do something about it after it started, really. It may be that the severity doesn't turn out to be what it could be after the thermal runaway started. But personally, if anyone asked me, I would not advise them to try and stay and fight that fire because of how rapidly they can grow. If you just do a little bit of searching on YouTube, you can see all sorts of incidents of people that have their home security cameras. And you can see somewhere in that shot, their e-bike is on charge. And it's really alarming. There's actually even worse. There's some videos in elevators. And, of course, that's a really grim scenario. But the toxicity of the smoke, in terms of traditional toxicity, I won't address specific chemicals like the benzenes and their effects. But if you look at the yield of gases from unburned battery gas, you tend to see very high CO. So up to 30% to 40% CO, whereas your standard underventilated compartment fire with typical fuels is maybe around 6% or 7% CO. So the release of that gas can be very toxic in a closed compartment. So I think it's just essential that people leave. The FDNY, the Fire Department of New York City, has partnered with us on developing some guidelines. And so we always refer to what they recommend you do if you have these devices. I mean, they recognize that these are becoming essential for people's livelihood, especially in New York City. There's a whole economy around e-bikes now enabling jobs. And so it kind of takes away someone's livelihood to say you cannot have this. So what they've tried to do is create this compilation of things you can do, like don't charge it between you and your path of egress. Don't leave the charger unattended. Make sure that the chargers from the original equipment manufacturer. There are some battery pack safety standards that you should be looking for when you're buying battery packs. But part of the challenge that I feel a little bit is out of our reach as fire researchers is the socioeconomic system which drives that. researchers is the socioeconomic system which drives that. So I'll just address it and say that that's a problem, but it's not really something that blowing up a ranch house with e-bikes can really solve right away. Of course, there are reasons why these types of vehicles are very popular, and I don't know if you remember that, but some, I don't know, 20 years ago, there was this secret meeting of billionaires who were presented with Segway device, Bill Gates and stuff, and they all came and said the mobility will never look the same. And in the end, what we got is a chariot for security in shopping malls. And this revolution did not happen at all. But then again, we suddenly got a ton of simple mobility units that allow you to travel 10, 20, 30 kilometers, actually enough to get your work environment and go back home without sweat, without worrying, quite quickly, fairly safely, very cheaply, easily. So indeed, it is doing some sort of revolution, silent revolution in the way how people can move, especially in large cities. That also means that people are taking them together with them into buses, into metro, into offices, into waiting rooms. It's very interesting how it changes the landscape. But that's also why we're talking in this podcast. It's not about everyone should ban e-mobility devices and then stay away because it's the devil's work. It's about understanding them and finding ways how can we live with them safely. My next question would be how big are these fires? I have recently attended a workshop by IFEP, it's an institute in Germany, who are doing e-bike tests in their calorimeter. And if I'm not wrong, they've reached something like one megawatt within like one minute from the start of the fire. And I thought that's an interesting number. There's a very large fire developing very, very quickly, like one megawatt under one minute. That's quicker than ultra-fast fire. Ultra-fast is 75 seconds, right? Yeah. That's crazy. What's your experience with burning these things? Well, it's a pretty wide field, but the lesser engineered products, the ones that really, I think, have not quite taken consequences of a failure in mind, tend to have those very alarming growth rates. So I'll give an example that's not quite e-mobility, but when we were preparing for this series of tests in the garage that we talked about earlier, we wanted to create a representation of a residential energy storage system by simulating the construction. So we looked at some of the features and we said, well, we need some partitions inside to sort of limit propagation rates between cells. And we roughly simulated the same electrochemical capacity. And so we ran these pre-tests where we said, does this roughly approximate in terms of fire growth rate of what we're seeing when we test real residential products? We didn't want to test a real residential product because we can buy that and then put it in our research tests and make some manufacturer look horrible. And then our results are also tied to that one specific type of product. So when we forced propagation in our sort of design 1.0, it was essentially just about 1500 of those e-cigarette 18650 style cells. There were some partitions, but we achieved about seven megawatts within about 30 seconds, which is just truly astounding. Okay. We did. Yeah. So that's, and I would say that that's something that would represent potential fire growth hazard of a DIY energy storage system. You may see some of those like on YouTube, you see instructions on how to pull all these cylindrical cells out of an EV battery pack and build your own. But the e-bikes that we've been testing are on the order of what you said, maybe about a megawatt within 30 seconds to a minute. It can be very fast. That's very interesting. And in the next iterations of your mock-up energy storage system, did you achieve lesser heat release rates? How did you improve that? We did. We did. And so we did that by essentially getting a little bit more detailed, investing more time in how we did all the partitioning. Instead of having them sort of all agglomerated inside one enclosure, we did 30 cell packs, which are closer to like these 100 amp hour cells that you might see sort of commercially available now. And actually their heat release rate and sort of thermal runaway characteristics are kind of similar to what was tested at about the 100 amp hour scale. And I know DK talked about that too. It's kind of a popular cell format. And once we did that, what we saw is this standard fire growth rate curve. I know you mentioned that it could be sort of like a T-squared curve, but it's not necessarily a consistent growth rate. You may have the thermal runaway of an individual cell, and then some heat propagates from that cell to those around it, and eventually you get another one. And so you get these very quick releases of gas and then flaming. you get these very quick releases of gas and then flaming. And so it looks almost kind of like a sawtooth heat release rate profile until eventually you get ignition of the whole unit. And then it really kind of takes off, becomes more like a typical heat release rate curve. Did you ever try and measure the release, the gas release velocity or the quantities of gas release when a thermal runaway occurs. I was thinking, like, when I want to make the simulation of a battery fire scenario in any setting, I mean, I have the full capability to introduce energy at whatever rate I want and produce gases at whatever rate I want. That's not a problem. I can do 1 megawatt 30 seconds, not a problem. they won't. That's not a problem. I can do 1 megawatt 30 seconds, not a problem. My worry came from the fact that this initial release has a certain kinetic energy to it. I mean, it's not anymore, you know, a free-burning item. It's not anymore a buoyant plume on its own. It acts differently in the physics. It has inertia in the gases, it has velocity. Have you ever tried to quantify these features of these flows? I don't know if this will answer your question perfectly, but yes, in two different ways. So in the way that I think you're speaking about more directly, the velocity of that gas coming out of the product is going to depend entirely on the enclosure design. So in a more open rack that you might have with an energy storage system, the gas velocity coming out of the cell may be very high, and then slow by the time it's kind of coming out of the rack. It may be sort of buoyancy-driven by that point. When we tested some EV enclosures some years ago, there's sort of this test where you expose them to a pool fire and pull the pool fire away. The EV battery packs tend to be very tightly closed. And so the electrical connectors would melt out and turn into these sort of like rocket nozzles. And so we've got this video that we internally refer to as the fire mustache because it looks like a mustache. But there's these flames jetting maybe seven feet out the sides. And so that's very high velocity. maybe seven feet out the sides. And so that's very high velocity. What we've found more meaningful is in doing measurements of what kinds of gas come out and what volumes come out. And that's really more focused for energy storage systems. So if you're a fire protection engineer designing the safety features of a containerized energy storage system, you need to know what the flammability characteristics or explosability characteristics are of that gas. That comes from knowing what its closed vessel deflagration pressure are, what its burning velocity is, and how much of it comes out. You have to make some assumptions about rate. So you might have to model that. And we worked with Bob Zalosh on a paper where he proposes a model for how you can just do a very simple sort of exponential decay. You see you have this kind of like step release and then exponential decay. But it goes into determining what types of deflagration vents that you put on an enclosure. Or if you take a different path, the requirements for your exhaust system to sort of detect the gases and then activate very quickly and exhaust whatever compartment that you're concerned about. So it's not just related to the technology of the cell itself, but also the enclosure in which the cell is contained. And eventual safety features like release valves and any connectors, any openings in this enclosure will drive. That makes sense. You release a lot of gas in an enclosed space, so it has to ventilate somewhere. You've mentioned energy storage systems a lot, and as you said before, you quickly transitioned from being the hoverboard guy into someone testing the storage systems. I wonder, what type of tests does one go through to certify an energy storage system and prove that it is safe? How does UL test these type of devices? So we developed a standard called UL9540A. It's now an anti-standard. It's binational, so it's a consensus-based standard. And that's tests that we use to evaluate the fire and explosion characteristics of an energy storage system that can have thermal runaway. So what we do right off the bat is determine at the cell level if that product can have thermal runaway. There are some amazing products that are not lithium ion chemistries that don't have thermal runaways. that are not lithium ion chemistries that don't have thermal runaways. But, okay, so then we'll proceed as you just kind of alluded to, to a level where you're testing a battery pack, maybe a module. And that helps you understand propagation rate and the amount of gas that can come off from propagation. And then we go up from module level to unit level and look at thermal runaway propagation from module to module within an enclosed rack, or I should say within a single rack. And then if needed, we can go all the way up to testing a container, which has got fire protection features like pressure relief vents or sprinkler systems, what have you. So what's really interesting is that we ourselves at UL, I should say my colleagues now at the for-profit side of UL, we still are not able to certify the complete fire and explosion safety of an energy storage system. Right now, what people do is they run this test and they get a data report that can be used by an engineer to design a safety system. Then that has to be evaluated by an AHJ. So certification would certainly simplify that process, but we're not quite there because we and some others believe that we need a couple more tests to completely evaluate the explosion hazard side. And how do you initiate the failure in this test? I mean, you have to initiate somehow. You overcharge, you overheat, you nail them. We know that there are many different product designs. So, for example, we feel the best way is to go by heating. But if someone delivers us a product where all the cells are welded together and you cannot get a heater in there, you may need to use a different method to achieve thermal runaway. So our standard is written so that the heating of the cells is really what causes the thermal runaway of that one or more cells. But if you sort of read between the lines of the standard, the point is to establish what happens, how much hazard is developed when propagation happens. So we're really happy with any methodology that can reveal whether or not there will be propagation, because that's really when the consequences start to develop. And that's what you need to design a fire protection system to handle. By propagation, you mean cell to cell? Yeah, that's correct. And does the state of charge be important in these tests? Or in your case, you just have a certain value which you test them with? Yeah, absolutely. So we require it to be 100% state of charge because that's essentially how you get the most severe thermal runaway. There's some good research by University of Maryland that shows that it sort of doesn't really matter after about 75% state of charge, but it allows us to consistently evaluate all products across the board. And in your research into the threats caused by battery systems, were you also simulating scenarios where something would be overcharged or you just assume a fire happens from thermal runaway and you simulate the thermal runaway? Well, yeah. So it's the propagation of thermal runaway from cell to cell that really drives whatever the end hazard is. So this training module that I mentioned that we're working on at FSRI, we're sort of hoping it'll be out by the end of the month, addresses five different types of scenarios that can happen from propagating thermal runaway. So the batteries are essentially, to me, they're like a gas leak. So they're leaking this flammable gas. If that ignites, it could be a fire. If it accumulates, it could be an explosion hazard. And it can kind of be anywhere in between. You could have a fire that burns in this battery pack and then consumes all the oxygen in a room, and the batteries keep propagating, and now you sort of have this extra flammable gas layer that's now accumulated in this room. And that's kind of similar. I don't know if you heard about the explosion which occurred in Surprise, Arizona, with the energy storage system. That's kind of similar to what occurred in Surprise, Arizona, this accumulation of gases. And when first responders arrived and opened the door to the structure, they enabled this exchange of those gases with air and created a flammable mixture. So it's remarkable to me how complicated the large-scale fire dynamics can become. They, you know, enabled this exchange of those gases with air and created a flammable mixture. So it's remarkable to me how complicated the large-scale fire dynamics can become. I really love how you take a very, very complicated issue of a battery fire and just, you know, cut it into manageable pieces. Like, not worrying about how thermal runaway happens, but figuring out what happens from that point. And I guess there's a lot of people working in battery safety who focus only on how it happens that the thermal runaway happens. And then they can fuel your data with the probabilities and stuff. And you can focus on the gas releases and the consequences of the fires. I really appreciate this way. Well, I'm really kind of excited because you had the guests on your show already. I listened to Mr. Rastucci's podcast episode with you, and I'm very appreciative of the work they do because, you know, essentially what I'm trying to do with FSRI is integrate all of that phenomenal research into this more accessible understanding of how hazards develop. And, you know, sort of selfishly, this was something I had to do in order to do safe testing of products. There's one very specific test we ran. It was an energy storage system we put in our large scale facility that weighed about 25,000 pounds. It was really, really big. And so our first success was convincing our EHS department that we could run this test, but it required breaking down all these different hazards and how they develop and making this giant flow chart that we kept on the table during the test. And we said, these are all our termination conditions when the hazards may become too much for the lab and we have to shut this test down. And so that kind of was a spark, that one test where we said, wow, we could really map out how these hazards develop and we should be doing it because it helps us to perform testing more safely. And then that turned into, well, maybe we could turn this into like a guide for first responders or a guide for other people to better understand how these hazards can start to develop. And maybe from there, we can get to better decisions on where you put your e-bike, for example. Is it between you and your front door? Maybe you do something a little less risky. When the fire scientists start to worry about the integrity of a fire lab while doing experiment, that's the point where the public should be a little concerned with the scale of threats we're talking about. But, yeah, I've been there, done that, had tests that we were very scared about the lab. But, actually, as you said, it's interesting that by solving the issues with carrying the tests, by understanding the threats that are for your own unit, you start to develop a better understanding of the consumer of the product. And maybe some of these safety guidances for yourself can be useful for someone outside, right? Yeah, absolutely. So I've been patiently waiting for my moment to strike. I'm not a risk person, but something that I've really observed just so continuously is that, you know, really observed just so continuously is that, you know, we're very basic understanding of risk is the frequency times the severity. You know, you've got this standard matrix. And I think the battery industry, especially for energy storage, but really everywhere, has worked really hard on reducing the frequency of battery incidents. And only, I think, recently, and through the creation of standards like NFPA 55, the energy storage system safety standard, and some of our UL standards, it makes manufacturers more aware that some of these consequences are possible. And so then their design 2.0 or their design 3.0 starts to really incorporate more safety features that lessen the severity of some of those consequences. And that's where I feel the most personal gratification that I know we've had some success by seeing when there's an incident that occurs, the severity is manageable. And that test I mentioned in our large scale fire lab, we ended up redoing that test years later and they achieved the result they were looking for but still had a very large fire and that was really great because it meant that their separation distances and their other safety features prevented one unit from you know causing the whole loss of this energy storage you know installation it's really uh been very exciting to watch this you know development for the, one more question about limiting the severity. We've talked it briefly before the recording, but the role of sprinklers, residential sprinklers in these threats, do you have an experience to what extent a residential sprinkler can contain a fire that starts at a mobility device or a small system? Not personal experience, but yeah, as luck would have it, this incident I was talking about with this battalion chief from Virginia yesterday, he mentioned that the residential sprinkler was able to hold this closet fire in check until the fire department arrived so that the scooter fire had not overwhelmed that sprinkler. But in our follow-up e-bike tests that we're looking to plan to run this spring, we want to look at some studies where we place an e-bike with other furnishings and do the e-bike as the first item ignited and also do the e-bike as the second item ignited and see if the residential sprinklers are able to contain those types of scenarios. I think that's very interesting research. And have you ever looked into storage systems for e-mobility devices? You know, like in Netherlands, for example, they would have these endless car parks or bike parks for bicycles and small devices. And in Poland, also in modern skyscrapers, we have these places where people can keep their mobility devices. I wonder what type of safety systems we should start designing for those. Yeah, it's interesting. I've come up with some great engineering ideas that are not attractive to the people that actually own these devices. But the way we store propane tanks in these outside caged units, you know, I think that that gets you your separation. It may get you your containment. But there's, interestingly enough, there's an industry that's responding to some of these hazards. So it's sort of like flammable liquid storage cabinets, painted a different color so it's, you know, battery appropriate, like blue or green. And they're marketed for storing, you know, so power tool packs or e-bike batteries, whatever fits inside the shelving. And so there's been a lot of requests for UL to develop a standard for these cabinets or these containers. Oh, that's very interesting, yeah. Yeah, and we know that it's needed because – so we ran some demonstration tests to say, well, is there a real hazard there? And absolutely, we blew the door off the cabinet we tested in the first try. So we know that it's needed. There would need to be some advanced safety features to contain whatever occurs inside. But yeah, I think that would solve such a huge part of the problem. So maybe you have a final message or one thing that you would like people to remember from this interesting episode. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, I think as someone that's now trying to better understand the hazards at a higher level to develop this fundamental guidance for how battery hazards develop in all these different types of places where you might have a power bank inside a overhead compartment inside a plane or where you may have a battery thermal runaway inside a closed energy storage unit. I think that if we have that type of information and we can tie together all this fantastic research from all around the globe and the other guests that have been on your show, we can have a better understanding for how to respond to types of battery incidents, for how we use our batteries. And, you know, I think the goal is to better understand every time you're deploying some product with a battery, be aware of those hazards, be aware of how you're using it. And you can actually have some personal impact on reducing your own risk drivers. So whether that's reducing the likelihood you're going to have a thermal runaway or reducing the consequences of if you do have a thermal runaway. But I agree with your previous episodes that I don't think we need to, you know, run in fear from lithium ion batteries. We need to understand them so we can do just as we have with every other, you know, pop-up fire hazard that has occurred over 100 years of, you know, fire research to, you know, make sure that we mitigate it and we move on. And, you know, next time it'll be, hopefully, it's microgravity space hazards as we all move to Mars. I must say I'm not very proud, but I may be responsible for a little fear-mongering about immobility devices in Poland. But I really feel that having this type of hazard at residential setting, which is not ready for a fire, I wonder, is there any guidance or any advice we could give to consumers of e-mobility devices who want to purchase one and would like to ensure maximum safety of that? Is there any good advice we could give to people? Yeah, absolutely. And the disclaimer is, please visit FDNY's recommended guidelines for using and buying and storing these devices. In case I miss them, just to rattle them off quickly, to try and buy products which have been third-party evaluated, you know, UL or others, to use the same charger, not some aftermarket charger. Charge them attended, so don't leave them unattended and charging. Charge them inside the environmental conditions that they say they're supposed to be for. So not too hot, not too cold. And also be mindful of where you're storing them. Don't store them near other combustibles and don't just store them between yourself and your means of egress. Those are the top ones. But, you know, as I mentioned, those guidelines are fantastic. And they'll be added to as we continue to do research with our partners. That's fantastic. That helps me a lot. I'll spread this in Poland for sure, and hopefully I'll be a little less worried about fear-mongering. Sometimes a little bit of fear-mongering is necessary for people to catch up. Well, it's good motivation. I think it's natural to have sound. Yeah, I feel obligated for the safety of my colleagues and other people in here. And I guess you working in such an institution, you also feel this obligation towards the society that when the giant fire comes, we should have seen that. So nowadays, I have this feeling, you know, whenever I see something that me as a fire professional, I feel that something is risky. I should rather act and communicate because if something bad happens, in a way, it's in my fold a little bit as well. So, yeah, that's the mindset. But I love the personal responsibility. I mean, I think that's what drives many of us in this industry. Adam, thank you so much. It was a huge pleasure to talk about the e-mobile devices, storage systems, and other aspects of lithium-ion battery safety. I'm very happy to see how this space evolves and grows and moves towards safety in general. It's been a pleasure to observe how this industry resonates with feedback, how it develops new strategies. And I guess you said you started in 2016 something. You can see a progress in this industry for sure, right? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. There has absolutely been progress, and it's in the major industries. And as I mentioned, every time a new use of batteries pops up, you witness sort of the same pattern. It is truly remarkable. Yeah, and let's hope this growth continues. Thank you, Adam, and have a great day. See you around. Okay, thank you very much for this opportunity, and I really had fun talking to you. And that's it. Thank you for listening. I hope you've enjoyed this talk. Actually, we were both ill during the recording. I had some flu. Adam had some flu. I hope you cannot tell the magic of sound mastering and editing. I'm really happy we toughened it out and we produced this episode. It's jam-packed with information. I thought it was very, very interesting. I highly admire how they can decouple the threads of lithium-ion batteries to find surrogate ways to work around these hazards and test them. It's very difficult, you know, to burn real stuff like batteries. It's not easy. It's expensive. So finding surrogate ways like the ones that Adam has shown in the episode is a brilliant way because we need to study them. We need to study the consequences and not always to study the consequences. You have to really have a thermal runaway or really have a real battery burning there. It's enough if you know what such fire can do and then measure these consequences. It's brilliant. As a fire scientist, I really really appreciate that. So that's it for today. I hope you've enjoyed this episode. As usual, thank you to the sponsor of the podcast, OFR Consultants, for helping me produce this thing. Before we end, one thing I wanted to bring your attention to. On Monday, I published a Q&A episode answering the questions from the listener experience survey. It was amazing to hear all the feedback from you. If you have not heard the Q&A 2, I have a lot of comments about the show, the future of the show, partnership and other things around the production of the podcast. So if you're interested in the podcast itself, the Q&A 2 is a good episode for you. itself. The Q&A too is a good episode for you. And if you're here just for the great interviews with fantastic guests, please join me next Wednesday. Another episode coming your way. This time another one in the series of episodes that change fire science, which seems to be fan favorite. So I hope you will like that a lot as well. See you there. Bye. This was the Fire Science Show. Thank you for listening and see you soon.
